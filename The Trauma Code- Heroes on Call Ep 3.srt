DEPARTMENT OF TRAUMA SURGERY
DUTY DOCTOR ROOM

3
00:02:00,161 --> 00:02:01,204
You a zombie?

4
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:10,046
Did you die? Are you dead?

5
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:13,550
Right. You're still alive.

6
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:24,435
Keep it down. Quiet.

7
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:28,648
Sh!

8
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:32,485
Oh! Oh! Again?

9
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:33,653
- Oh!
- What is it?

10
00:02:34,737 --> 00:02:36,489
Email from the audit office.

11
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:39,993
Well, Dr. Beck definitely
has been going all out.

12
00:02:40,076 --> 00:02:43,663
They wanna slash our budget
because we're operating at a loss.

13
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,377
Hello, this is the Trauma Unit.

14
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:52,881
Ah!

15
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:02,640
This is Yang Jae-won. Go ahead.

16
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:05,810
<i>Dr. Jae-won.</i>
<i>Multiple vehicle pile-up. Come quickly.</i>

17
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:06,895
On my way.

18
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:10,899
Dr. Baek. You need to wake up now.

19
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:12,775
A patient?

20
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:16,988
Yes. 119 is on its way.

21
00:03:17,071 --> 00:03:18,156
Let's go.

22
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:23,578
- I'm sorry.
- Oh!

23
00:03:23,661 --> 00:03:26,122
Dr. Baek, at this rate,
I'm gonna be the one facing death.

24
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:27,957
- You wanna test that?
- No, sir.

25
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:30,877
He's a good runner.

26
00:03:31,836 --> 00:03:33,004
Let's get the room ready.

27
00:03:33,087 --> 00:03:34,964
- They'll be here soon. Okay.
- Yes. Okay.

28
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:38,551
Are you okay?

29
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:39,761
- I'm sorry.
- Yes.

30
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:44,933
I'm sorry.

31
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:46,267
- Appreciate it.
- Sure.

32
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:52,941
Oh! Oh!

33
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:54,817
Here we are. What happened, Gangster?

34
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:58,238
- Uh, what do you mean, "Gangster"?
- Just get on with the debrief.

35
00:03:58,321 --> 00:04:00,823
Yeah. A dump truck hit a car
with two people inside.

36
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:08,122
<i>The roads are wet,</i>
<i>and the accident happened inside a tunnel,</i>

37
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:10,833
<i>so the driver and passenger in the car</i>
<i>right in front of the truck</i>

38
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:12,335
<i>took most of the damage.</i>

39
00:04:12,835 --> 00:04:14,212
<i>They're being transported here.</i>

00:04:14,712 --> 00:04:16,172
REGIONAL EMERGENCY MEDICAL CENTER

41
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:20,009
Let's see.

42
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:22,595
His stomach.

43
00:04:23,179 --> 00:04:25,306
Abdominal bleeding. It's too severe.

44
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:26,683
- Hey.
- Yes?

45
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:27,934
Resuscitation room now!

46
00:04:28,017 --> 00:04:29,143
- Yes, sir.
- Right.

47
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:34,190
- When did he lose consciousness?
- About 15 minutes ago.

48
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:38,987
Thanks.

49
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:46,953
- Get a line in. Take him to the OR.
- Understood. Right away.

50
00:04:47,036 --> 00:04:49,247
Dr. Baek. Another patient has arrived.

51
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:52,583
All right, make way.

52
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:53,668
You got it!

53
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:55,336
Okay.

54
00:04:58,923 --> 00:05:00,174
- Scissors.
- Here.

55
00:05:01,217 --> 00:05:03,052
We're taking the patient
to surgery.

56
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:05,263
- I'll be right there. Tell Anus!
- Yes, sir.

57
00:05:23,781 --> 00:05:25,533
Uh, please perform
the anesthesia.

58
00:05:25,616 --> 00:05:26,909
All right.

59
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:33,833
- Dr. Hwang.
- Yes?

60
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:35,626
Could you maybe
hurry up a little?

61
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:36,544
Come on.

62
00:05:36,627 --> 00:05:39,630
You know, I already feel uncomfortable
performing the anesthesia

63
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:41,466
without any testing first.

64
00:05:41,549 --> 00:05:43,760
And now you're rushing me,
and I don't think that's right.

65
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:46,679
That's not what I meant.
The patient is in critical condition--

66
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:48,264
I know. Fine, fine.

67
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:50,808
I'll take care of it.
You just stay in your lane.

68
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:53,353
Hey, Doc? Look at the patient.

69
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:55,355
He's already on his twelfth unit of blood.

70
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:57,565
Are you gonna take the blame
if this guy dies?

71
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:00,735
Hold on.

72
00:06:01,235 --> 00:06:03,821
- What did that thing just say to me?
- "Th… That thing?"

73
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:05,031
- "That thing"?
- Yes.

74
00:06:05,114 --> 00:06:08,534
Some of us are running ragged,
and here you are, half-asleep,

75
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:09,827
calling me "that thing"?

76
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:11,454
What? Half-asleep?

77
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:13,039
- Did you hear that?
- Easy now.

78
00:06:13,122 --> 00:06:14,624
You don't think
I take this seriously?

79
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:17,001
- Use your words.
- I'm done using my words.

80
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:18,628
- I said enough!
- Dr. Hwang!

81
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:19,670
All right.

82
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:22,340
I'll get on the anesthesia
and get it done right away.

83
00:06:22,423 --> 00:06:24,842
But, Dr. Yang, I need to know her name.

84
00:06:25,426 --> 00:06:28,012
I'm ready to file a formal complaint
with the head of the department.

85
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:29,972
- I'll make sure she's penalized.
- Stop!

86
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:31,974
- What's your name?
- Oh yeah?

87
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:34,602
Hey, Anesthetics.
What's the problem?

88
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:36,062
What's your name?

89
00:06:36,145 --> 00:06:37,021
Sir?

90
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:40,191
Don't ask questions
that you can't answer.

91
00:06:40,274 --> 00:06:43,027
Unless you've got a death wish,
you'd better start prepping for surgery.

92
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:45,780
Yes, Doctor.
I'll get started right away. Go.

93
00:06:45,863 --> 00:06:47,323
I'll go scrub in.

94
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:52,954
- Hey, Gangster.
- Yes?

95
00:06:53,037 --> 00:06:56,040
What takes priority
when you have a patient in front of you?

96
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:57,792
Sorry, Doctor.

97
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:02,004
Don't pick fights
with just anyone.

98
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:05,174
Leave the fighting… to me.

99
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:10,388
Okay.

100
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:16,561
What do you think of Dr. Baek Kang-hyuk?

101
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:20,857
I don't know him well enough
to have an opinion.

102
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:24,902
I just want
an honest assessment of the man.

103
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:30,199
You encounter different types of surgeons
as an anesthesiology resident. Right?

104
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:31,451
Mm…

105
00:07:32,034 --> 00:07:33,578
Well, Dr. Baek is…

106
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:36,873
He's incredible.

107
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:40,334
He performed a decompression
of intracranial pressure

108
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:43,004
and a partial lung resection
in under two hours.

109
00:07:43,754 --> 00:07:46,257
Well, I think that speaks for itself.

110
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:47,967
All right.

111
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:50,803
Well, I guess his skills are
as good as they say.

112
00:07:51,512 --> 00:07:55,600
It's unfortunate that when you have
that kind of individualized genius,

113
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:58,769
it can actually do harm
to the wider organization.

114
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:08,321
On that note, if there's any… information
that you could provide me with,

115
00:08:08,404 --> 00:08:13,493
I would be inclined to help you with
anything you need down the track.

116
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:20,416
A spy. Is that what you're looking for?

117
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,339
Oh goodness.
Just look at the moon tonight.

118
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:35,014
SURGERY IN PROGRESS

119
00:08:35,806 --> 00:08:41,979
{\an8}NAME: LEE GI-YEONG, GENDER: MALE
HEMOPERITONEUM

120
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:45,316
Irrigation.

121
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,404
Blood pressure's dropping.

122
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:52,281
- Hurry with the inotropics.
- Yes, sir.

123
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:54,242
- Warm saline, please.
- Okay.

124
00:08:57,036 --> 00:09:00,039
- Anus. Suction. Focus!
- Yes, Doctor.

125
00:09:00,122 --> 00:09:02,166
Inotropics are in.

126
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,585
Get 30 more units of blood.
Increase transfusion rate.

127
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:05,878
Okay.

128
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:08,965
Uh, Dr. Baek? There's too much bleeding.

129
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:10,841
We need to find the source
of the bleeding.

130
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:17,723
BP is still dropping.
It's 60 over 40 now.

131
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:19,892
Dr. Baek?

132
00:09:21,852 --> 00:09:23,271
Dr. Baek, what should we do next?

133
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:30,194
Dr. Baek! Dr. Baek, we'll lose the patient
if we keep going like this!

134
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:35,491
Dr. Baek.

135
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:36,867
<i>Dr. Baek!</i>

136
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:54,802
Suture.
Quickly. It's slippery.

137
00:09:58,431 --> 00:09:59,682
How did you find that?

138
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:01,684
I couldn't see anything.

139
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:04,270
Suction. Stay focused!
I'm not doing this alone.

140
00:10:04,353 --> 00:10:05,479
Yes, Doctor.

141
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:26,334
The superior mesenteric artery
was damaged.

142
00:10:27,084 --> 00:10:29,837
Anus, get the omni retractor
and cauterize the bleeding.

143
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:31,172
Okay.

144
00:10:38,262 --> 00:10:40,931
Uh, what do we do about the liver?

145
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:43,309
We can't cauterize all of this.

146
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:45,353
The damage is far too extensive.

147
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:48,731
I think we'll need to remove at least 80%
to stabilize the bleeding.

148
00:10:49,523 --> 00:10:50,983
A ruptured liver.

149
00:10:52,276 --> 00:10:54,445
He's had cirrhosis of the liver too.

150
00:10:54,528 --> 00:10:56,030
It's at least a Class B.

151
00:10:56,113 --> 00:10:58,366
Then his liver function
is basically at zero.

152
00:10:58,949 --> 00:11:00,409
Even if we stop the bleeding,

153
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:02,787
you think he'll survive?

154
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:04,997
Chances are slim. Gauze.

155
00:11:12,129 --> 00:11:13,297
In that case,

156
00:11:15,132 --> 00:11:18,219
shouldn't we just
close him up now, Dr. Baek?

157
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:21,722
Medicine is about probability.
Death is never certain.

158
00:11:22,598 --> 00:11:25,393
But even so,
it'll only buy him a few more hours.

159
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:27,103
We don't get credit for trying hard.

160
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:31,816
Oh.

161
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:34,985
There could be another option.

162
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:36,987
Jeez!
What the hell does she know?

163
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:39,448
Does she think she's a doctor now,
or what?

164
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:41,867
Think you could hold
your tongue for one minute?

165
00:11:42,451 --> 00:11:44,995
- Huh?
- That's Nurse Cheon Jang-mi.

166
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:47,832
She's been working here since
the days of Dr. Kwon.

167
00:11:48,332 --> 00:11:49,667
She's a fifth-year senior.

168
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:52,002
She's probably seen
more trauma cases than anyone.

169
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:53,796
And she's more experienced than you or me.

170
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:57,091
So… try showing her some respect.

171
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:02,722
Like kids at a playground.

172
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:03,639
Are you done?

173
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:06,016
- Sorry, Doctor.
- Sorry, Doctor.

174
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:10,146
Gangster,
what are you suggesting we do?

175
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:14,650
- What if he received a donor liver?
- Whose liver are we taking?

176
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:17,111
Yours? Mine? His?

177
00:12:18,195 --> 00:12:20,156
Uh, Dr. Baek, earlier today,

178
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:22,491
I ran into an organ donor coordinator.

179
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:25,828
- Yes.
- I'm sorry.

180
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:33,377
{\an8}ORGAN AND TISSUE DONOR CONSENT FORM

181
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:36,046
<i>The fact that they're here now</i>
<i>means that an organ donor</i>

182
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:37,506
<i>was declared brain-dead.</i>

183
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:40,134
- Get in touch with him right away.
- Yes, sir.

184
00:12:53,063 --> 00:12:54,440
Kang Chang-su speaking.

185
00:12:54,523 --> 00:12:57,735
We have a patient in need of
a liver transplant, and we're wondering…

186
00:12:57,818 --> 00:12:59,779
A patient's been
declared brain-dead, right?

187
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:01,906
- Has the surgery already begun?
<i>- Well…</i>

188
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:04,325
<i>Everything's been put on hold.</i>

189
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:07,828
Their next of kin said they'd come,
but we've lost contact.

190
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:09,747
So we're just waiting for them now.

191
00:13:10,247 --> 00:13:12,792
<i>You know how it is. We can't do anything</i>
<i>without their consent.</i>

192
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,335
Tell us their address.

193
00:13:14,418 --> 00:13:15,544
<i>Pardon?</i>

194
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:17,213
<i>Who was that?</i>

195
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:21,008
We'll send someone
to get their consent. Give us the address.

196
00:13:21,091 --> 00:13:23,177
<i>I can't. That would be illegal.</i>

197
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,345
Never mind that.

198
00:13:24,428 --> 00:13:26,138
Saving the patient comes first,
doesn't it?

199
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:28,390
Dr. Baek,
let's check their blood type first.

200
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:29,975
If the donor's blood type isn't O,

201
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:32,019
then it would be difficult
even with their consent.

202
00:13:32,102 --> 00:13:33,687
Lee Gi-yeong's blood type is O.

203
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:34,980
<i>Just a moment.</i>

204
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:36,899
Uh, their name again?

205
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:38,275
<i>Oh, the patient?</i>

206
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:40,152
<i>The patient's name is Lee Gi-yeong.</i>

207
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:45,574
NEXT OF KIN INFORMATION: LEE GI-YEONG, SON
LEE HYE-YEONG, DAUGHTER

208
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:48,327
We have the donor's son's name
on the next of kin file,

209
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:50,329
and it's the same as your patient's.

210
00:13:51,413 --> 00:13:53,332
Oh. Just a moment.

211
00:13:57,127 --> 00:13:59,922
Uh, is the date of birth July 12, 1988?

212
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:02,007
That's right.

213
00:14:04,051 --> 00:14:05,469
You don't think…

214
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:08,097
He's the donor's family?

215
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:21,110
Hold on. Could that woman be…

216
00:14:24,738 --> 00:14:27,157
<i>There was someone</i>
<i>in the passenger seat with him.</i>

217
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:28,826
<i>Do you know who it is?</i>

218
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:30,452
<i>It's probably</i>

219
00:14:31,328 --> 00:14:33,205
<i>the daughter, Lee Hye-yeong.</i>

220
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:37,835
<i>So both siblings were</i>
<i>on their way to our hospital</i>

221
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:42,882
<i>to see their father, who was brain-dead</i>
<i>when they got into an accident.</i>

222
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:56,103
That's good.

223
00:14:57,521 --> 00:14:59,982
Can you confirm
the donor's blood type is O?

224
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:02,151
<i>Well, that is his blood type, but…</i>

225
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:04,904
We'll proceed with
a transplant between immediate family.

226
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:08,532
What? Um, but that's illegal
without next of kin--

227
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:10,743
Oh yeah?
The next of kin are unconscious,

228
00:15:10,826 --> 00:15:12,453
so who do you expect to give consent?

229
00:15:12,536 --> 00:15:14,872
Lee Gi-yeong is gonna die
without that liver.

230
00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:16,916
<i>You could add him to</i>
<i>the transplant waitlist--</i>

231
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:18,959
Are you serious right now?!

232
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:21,837
You want us to wait
till the patient dies? Huh?

233
00:15:24,798 --> 00:15:27,718
We will now proceed with
Mr. Lee Gi-yeong's liver transplant.

234
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:32,056
If any issues arise from this,

235
00:15:33,557 --> 00:15:35,434
I will take full responsibility.

236
00:15:40,981 --> 00:15:42,107
All right, fine.

237
00:15:42,691 --> 00:15:43,776
I'll rush it through.

238
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:47,905
Oh, and, uh,

239
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:49,865
I need a favor.

240
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:57,915
We're transplanting
the brain-dead patient's liver.

241
00:15:57,998 --> 00:15:59,375
The surgery will begin at once.

242
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:02,461
So contact the recipients
of the other organs.

243
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:04,046
Oh, uh, okay. I'll do that.

244
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:05,381
And also,

245
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:09,301
Dr. Baek has made a request.

246
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:12,262
We got lucky today.

247
00:16:13,013 --> 00:16:16,350
I thought we might lose this patient,
but now he has a donor liver.

248
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:18,727
Sure,
but what you're saying is a little…

249
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:20,896
Can you
save a brain-dead patient?

250
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:21,939
Sir?

251
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:24,066
Answer me.

252
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:28,112
No.

253
00:16:29,196 --> 00:16:30,864
I can save Lee Gi-yeong.

254
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:34,868
So what do you think
the right decision is?

255
00:16:36,203 --> 00:16:37,287
Sorry, sir.

256
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:43,794
I will save him, no matter what.

257
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:47,089
And I'll make sure the donor

258
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:49,800
passes away in peace.

259
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:38,015
You may begin.

260
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:40,184
A moment of silence.

261
00:17:40,684 --> 00:17:42,061
Right. Okay.

262
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:45,522
Dr. Baek.
You only gave us a second just now.

263
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:46,690
He'd understand.

264
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:49,985
He'd care more about saving his child
than our moment of silence.

265
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:50,903
Scalpel.

266
00:17:55,657 --> 00:18:02,581
{\an8}NAME: LEE JI-YEONG, GENDER: MALE
ORGAN DONATION

267
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:49,128
One more.

268
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:15,279
It's all ready.

269
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:19,575
Huh?

270
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:21,160
Why are you running?

271
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:23,203
We have another patient. Lee Hye-yeong.

272
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:24,121
Oh!

273
00:19:24,204 --> 00:19:26,498
- Wait, Dr. Baek. Dr. Baek. Just a moment.
- Oh!

274
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:27,833
- Oh!
- What? What is it?

275
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:29,626
Ah shit.

276
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:32,588
I was gonna tell him about
the audit team's email earlier.

277
00:19:33,463 --> 00:19:35,340
Damn.

278
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:39,720
Hey, hey.
Which OR is the female patient in?

279
00:19:39,803 --> 00:19:42,514
Ah, in OR 27 in the main building.

280
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:43,724
Ah. Okay.

281
00:19:43,807 --> 00:19:45,267
Dr. Jung Jun-su is in surgery now!

282
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:46,727
- Huh?
- Got it?

283
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:47,644
Oh!

284
00:19:50,063 --> 00:19:51,440
Whoa, Dr. Baek. Just wait.

285
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:52,816
Uh, uh…

286
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:56,236
They transferred her to orthopedics.
They're taking care of her now.

287
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,113
Come on. She's a major trauma patient.

288
00:19:58,197 --> 00:19:59,948
- No, well, the thing is…
- Come on!

289
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:03,660
Dr. Jung Jun-su,
the one performing the surgery, is…

290
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:07,497
quite similar to you.

291
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:08,624
What?

292
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:10,209
- He's a genius?
- Yes.

293
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:11,168
Huh?

294
00:20:11,251 --> 00:20:12,294
Uh, no, he's not…

295
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:15,714
It's just that he's… a little…

296
00:20:17,674 --> 00:20:18,675
fiery.

297
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:23,513
All right. I understand.
I just need to check something.

298
00:20:28,268 --> 00:20:30,395
Damn it!
Hold that thing properly!

299
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:37,319
What the…

300
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:39,696
Yes, I'm Baek Kang-hyuk of trauma surgery.

301
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,490
I just need to check on something.

302
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:42,824
Huh.

303
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:44,785
Oh, <i>that </i>Dr. Baek.

304
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:47,955
I've heard a lot about you
from Dr. Han Yu-rim.

305
00:20:49,998 --> 00:20:52,334
He took my protégé!

306
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:55,754
I could chew him up,
and it still wouldn't be enough.

307
00:20:55,837 --> 00:20:58,465
DIE, BAEK KANG-HYUK

308
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:01,176
My teacup…

309
00:21:02,886 --> 00:21:03,887
Baek Kang-hyuk!

310
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:09,893
I heard you triaged her.
You here to check on her status now?

311
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:13,313
Well, you should've done
a better job to begin with.

312
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:17,401
'Cause you've made this particularly
difficult for me. Just look at this mess.

313
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:20,904
Are there ever
any easy patients?

314
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:23,156
It's just up to you to do a good job.

315
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:28,620
- What was that, son?
- Uh…

316
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:33,125
If I'm your child, I guess…
that makes me the son of a bitch.

317
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:34,835
You little bastard. Listen here.

318
00:21:34,918 --> 00:21:37,045
Wait, wait, wait.
Dr. Jung, it's all right.

319
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:39,673
Uh, the board of directors
won't let it slide

320
00:21:39,756 --> 00:21:41,216
if you hit someone again.

321
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:46,930
Jesus Christ.
Spread them out, moron!

322
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:52,728
{\an8}Uh,
her creatine has really spiked.

323
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:55,981
{\an8}Nurse? What's the patient's IO like?

324
00:21:56,064 --> 00:21:59,484
{\an8}Fluids and blood transfusions
add up to approximately 2,000 liters,

325
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:01,528
but there hasn't been any urine output.

326
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:03,989
There's no kidney function.

327
00:22:04,072 --> 00:22:07,117
{\an8}No.
She's already experiencing hydronephrosis.

328
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,745
{\an8}And lab results show
that uremia's developing too.

329
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:13,040
Then will she be
in the nephrology ward?

330
00:22:13,123 --> 00:22:16,543
Yes. Dr. Jeong-u of nephrology
is on his way here right now.

331
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,468
- This is Shin Jeong-u.
<i>- This is Baek Kang-hyuk of trauma surgery.</i>

332
00:22:24,551 --> 00:22:26,386
- Yes?
<i>- Lee Hye-yeong is your patient, right?</i>

333
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:27,554
Lee Hye-yeong?

334
00:22:27,637 --> 00:22:29,556
<i>Yes. What is your current</i>
<i>care plan for her?</i>

335
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:34,895
Well, I'll have her on dialysis
and monitor her labs.

336
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:37,481
That is a death sentence.

337
00:22:37,564 --> 00:22:41,068
The mortality rate is too high in
trauma patients with acute renal failure.

338
00:22:41,151 --> 00:22:45,072
<i>I know that, but our hands are tied.</i>
<i>It's not like we can just find a kidney.</i>

339
00:22:45,155 --> 00:22:46,156
I've…

340
00:22:47,157 --> 00:22:48,575
I've already secured one.

341
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:53,038
<i>Oh, and, uh, I need a favor.</i>

342
00:22:54,748 --> 00:22:57,834
I want you to reserve a kidney
when we retrieve that liver.

343
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:02,839
I have a feeling that
the patient has acute renal failure.

344
00:23:07,094 --> 00:23:10,931
I'll perform the transplant right away.
Could you begin dialysis in the OR?

345
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:28,448
The kidney has arrived.

346
00:23:30,992 --> 00:23:33,787
Doctor,
I heard all about the kidney.

347
00:23:34,287 --> 00:23:36,748
Yes, the donor is
Lee Hye-yeong's father.

348
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:39,960
I'll leave you to manage the dialysis.

349
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:42,129
I'll start now.

350
00:23:48,718 --> 00:23:50,095
- Anus.
- Yes?

351
00:23:50,178 --> 00:23:52,389
The patient
is in very serious condition.

352
00:23:52,472 --> 00:23:54,224
Let's do this in 30 minutes.

353
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:55,892
Yes, Dr. Baek.

354
00:23:56,393 --> 00:23:58,603
A kidney transplant
in 30 minutes?

355
00:23:59,646 --> 00:24:01,731
Man, you do talk a big game.

356
00:24:04,234 --> 00:24:05,068
Scalpel.

357
00:24:05,152 --> 00:24:10,699
{\an8}NAME: LEE HYE-YEONG, GENDER: FEMALE
KIDNEY TRANSPLANT

358
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:17,956
3-0.

359
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:37,392
Now, cut.

360
00:24:39,394 --> 00:24:40,729
Okay. Done.

361
00:24:41,229 --> 00:24:43,565
That took exactly 24 minutes.

362
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:57,662
I know. I'm amazing.

363
00:24:58,246 --> 00:25:00,248
You don't have to keep staring. Let's go.

364
00:25:01,708 --> 00:25:02,584
After you.

365
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:07,172
Hey.

366
00:25:07,881 --> 00:25:09,758
How could you be yawning right now?

367
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:12,594
Aren't we all done now?

368
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:16,473
And you were just starting to show
some promise today. But now it's gone.

369
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:18,975
Let's go. We have somewhere to be.

370
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:21,978
- Where, Doctor?
- Just follow me.

371
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:40,163
A moment of silence first.

372
00:25:42,499 --> 00:25:44,376
Uh, didn't we do that earlier?

373
00:25:45,335 --> 00:25:46,670
We were in a hurry then.

374
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:48,630
We have time now.

375
00:25:49,256 --> 00:25:50,257
So let's do it.

376
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:52,259
Uh…

377
00:25:54,261 --> 00:25:55,929
I guess I should've known better.

378
00:25:56,596 --> 00:25:58,932
It's a noble sacrifice, organ donation.

379
00:26:00,517 --> 00:26:01,351
We should…

380
00:26:03,353 --> 00:26:04,688
offer our thanks.

381
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:10,235
Rest in peace…

382
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,405
Lee Gi-yeong.

383
00:26:45,186 --> 00:26:46,271
I'm tired.

384
00:26:54,321 --> 00:26:55,739
Wake up!

385
00:26:55,822 --> 00:26:58,241
Oh my.

386
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:00,452
You trying to crack your skull?

387
00:27:01,036 --> 00:27:01,911
Sorry.

388
00:27:03,163 --> 00:27:04,080
Where are you going?

389
00:27:04,164 --> 00:27:05,540
Outpatient appointments.

390
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:08,752
- We can do the rounds later after lunch.
- Okay.

391
00:27:20,221 --> 00:27:21,306
Only an hour?

392
00:27:21,389 --> 00:27:23,141
<i>Hey, Anus.</i>

393
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:26,936
He just called him "Anus."

394
00:27:28,521 --> 00:27:31,274
Wow. Now, that was just pure evil.

395
00:27:31,358 --> 00:27:33,109
Why? That's your name.

396
00:27:33,193 --> 00:27:34,986
It's what Dr. Baek calls you. Hmm?

397
00:27:37,113 --> 00:27:38,156
Meh.

398
00:27:38,239 --> 00:27:41,618
I've been in trauma surgery for so long,
and he still calls me Anus!

399
00:27:44,621 --> 00:27:45,622
Hey.

400
00:27:46,247 --> 00:27:48,833
It's not all that bad though.
You've lasted a month.

401
00:27:49,626 --> 00:27:51,503
Hey man. What do you think?

402
00:27:52,962 --> 00:27:54,881
You know what Dr. Baek
says to me most days?

403
00:27:54,964 --> 00:27:57,425
Number one, "Hey, Anus."
Number two, "You're too slow."

404
00:27:57,509 --> 00:28:00,762
Number three, "What do you think?
No sweat, no sweat, no sweat."

405
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:03,139
He says it's easy to remove a liver
and transplant a liver.

406
00:28:03,223 --> 00:28:06,559
It's easy to sew up an artery and even
make incisions into someone's heart.

407
00:28:06,643 --> 00:28:07,686
Come on, that is

408
00:28:09,145 --> 00:28:10,063
difficult.

409
00:28:12,315 --> 00:28:14,818
Ah, guess he's just the type
to brag about himself.

410
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:18,571
I wouldn't even be saying this
if it was all just talk.

411
00:28:18,655 --> 00:28:19,698
The thing is,

412
00:28:20,657 --> 00:28:22,867
it is easy for Dr. Baek though.

413
00:28:25,328 --> 00:28:26,496
Hmm.

414
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:28,373
Am I the strange one?

415
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:30,291
Huh?

416
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:32,961
Hmm, not at all.
It's all completely normal.

417
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:36,297
And your liver function tests as well.
There are no notable issues.

418
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:40,468
See you again in six months,
and if your test results are still normal,

419
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:43,138
well then,
it'll be your final visit with us.

420
00:28:43,221 --> 00:28:45,515
Dr. Baek, I appreciate that.

421
00:28:45,598 --> 00:28:47,392
I never properly thanked you.

422
00:28:47,475 --> 00:28:50,145
I was so out of it in the helicopter.

423
00:28:51,187 --> 00:28:52,897
Well, if you're that thankful,

424
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:55,316
could you do me a small favor?

425
00:28:56,651 --> 00:28:57,694
A favor?

426
00:29:01,698 --> 00:29:03,908
One, two, three.

427
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:14,043
You're the first doctor
who's asked for a picture.

428
00:29:14,127 --> 00:29:16,588
Well, I like to commemorate my patients.

429
00:29:20,508 --> 00:29:21,551
Thanks so much.

430
00:29:22,886 --> 00:29:25,722
Putting them all on display
is the least I can do.

431
00:29:25,805 --> 00:29:27,807
If not, no one would ever know.

432
00:29:27,891 --> 00:29:29,058
And they should know.

433
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:36,524
<i>Dr. Baek!</i>

434
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:40,945
Yang Jae-won, where are you?

435
00:29:41,029 --> 00:29:44,240
Where'd that snake go if he's not
at his outpatient appointments?

436
00:29:44,324 --> 00:29:45,283
Shit.

437
00:29:46,534 --> 00:29:48,244
Hi, ma'am. Are you lost?

438
00:29:49,078 --> 00:29:50,997
Oh, no. That's on the other floor.

439
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,081
The other building.

440
00:29:53,416 --> 00:29:54,459
Hey, Anus.

441
00:29:55,502 --> 00:29:56,336
Yes?

442
00:29:56,419 --> 00:29:59,047
This the first time you've seen
a liver transplant patient?

443
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:00,673
Yes.

444
00:30:00,757 --> 00:30:03,092
And you, Gangster?

445
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:04,969
First time.

446
00:30:06,387 --> 00:30:09,641
So, it's your first time caring
for someone post-transplant?

447
00:30:10,266 --> 00:30:11,100
Yes.

448
00:30:11,184 --> 00:30:12,644
Ah!

449
00:30:13,603 --> 00:30:14,729
That's not good.

450
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:18,691
I gotta teach you so both of you
can start pulling your own weight.

451
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:25,198
Uh. Ah…

452
00:30:25,281 --> 00:30:26,574
Oh, Dr. Baek, I, um…

453
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:28,785
{\an8}I wanted to speak with you
about something.

454
00:30:28,868 --> 00:30:29,828
Ah.

455
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:32,747
What? Why?

456
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:34,332
- Well…
- She told you?

457
00:30:35,124 --> 00:30:36,292
The thing is…

458
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:39,504
"Budget cuts"?

459
00:30:41,589 --> 00:30:43,299
You gotta be kidding me with this.

460
00:30:44,008 --> 00:30:46,469
The audit team's been sending us
email after email

461
00:30:46,553 --> 00:30:48,513
ever since you arrived at our hospital.

462
00:30:48,596 --> 00:30:53,643
Wait, so… tell me what the agency's
justification is for these budget cuts?

463
00:30:53,726 --> 00:30:55,520
It's more about
keeping a baseline.

464
00:30:56,145 --> 00:30:58,356
If you go above that,
your budget gets cut.

465
00:30:58,439 --> 00:30:59,482
Otherwise, it's all good.

466
00:30:59,566 --> 00:31:02,068
That's what I'm saying.
Their baseline is all wrong.

467
00:31:02,151 --> 00:31:05,280
I sent them a whole compilation
of theses and case reports.

468
00:31:07,156 --> 00:31:09,075
Look, I understand what you're saying.

469
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:15,248
Consider me. I am the epitome
of our hospital's trauma unit.

470
00:31:15,748 --> 00:31:18,209
A senior nurse
with only five years' experience.

471
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:21,129
I wouldn't be a senior in any other unit.

472
00:31:21,629 --> 00:31:24,757
We're barely getting by here.
I mean, this unit's all for show anyways.

473
00:31:24,841 --> 00:31:25,884
Understand?

474
00:31:26,968 --> 00:31:31,139
Just how do you think that our trauma unit
stayed afloat under these conditions?

475
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:34,642
We would all bow our heads to management,

476
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:36,352
then grovel before the directors

477
00:31:36,436 --> 00:31:38,229
and plead with the review board.

478
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:39,898
Somehow, we managed to survive.

479
00:31:39,981 --> 00:31:41,482
Those were our options.

480
00:31:42,525 --> 00:31:43,776
Great work, then.

481
00:31:44,277 --> 00:31:45,904
Is that what you wanted to hear?

482
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:51,492
If you keep doing what you're doing,
the Trauma Unit's done for.

483
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:54,203
- I wanna protect what we've built.
- Ah, Gangster.

484
00:31:55,371 --> 00:31:56,873
I disagree with you.

485
00:31:57,373 --> 00:31:59,042
- No. We're gonna--
- Dr. Baek!

486
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:01,544
There you are.

487
00:32:01,628 --> 00:32:02,462
Oh!

488
00:32:03,296 --> 00:32:05,548
Oh! So how are you doing?

489
00:32:08,009 --> 00:32:08,885
Why are you here?

490
00:32:09,469 --> 00:32:10,929
Come with me now!

491
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:12,597
Where?

492
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,390
You'll find out when we get there!

493
00:32:16,142 --> 00:32:17,602
I'd like to know beforehand.

494
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:23,274
Ah shit. This sucks.

495
00:32:31,532 --> 00:32:32,575
I'm sorry, sir.

496
00:32:38,122 --> 00:32:40,875
Okay, well, I know you all took
the time out to be here.

497
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:42,961
So… for today's meeting…

498
00:32:43,044 --> 00:32:45,630
Did you know
the meeting was canceled because of you?

499
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:48,466
I was under the impression
they weren't mandatory.

500
00:32:48,549 --> 00:32:49,759
Hey, uh…

501
00:32:49,842 --> 00:32:51,135
Uh-huh? Dr. Han. Hmm?

502
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:52,720
Ugh, this guy.

503
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:54,263
Ah, Dr. Baek.

504
00:32:54,347 --> 00:32:55,974
I texted and emailed everybody,

505
00:32:56,057 --> 00:32:58,810
requesting that they make time
for this meeting today.

506
00:32:59,394 --> 00:33:00,770
And still, you didn't come.

507
00:33:00,853 --> 00:33:01,980
Yep. I saw that.

508
00:33:02,063 --> 00:33:02,897
I just forgot.

509
00:33:05,692 --> 00:33:07,527
It happens. We all forget, right?

510
00:33:08,027 --> 00:33:10,029
Sure, it can happen. Yeah.

511
00:33:10,113 --> 00:33:11,072
However…

512
00:33:13,116 --> 00:33:15,118
…the loss incurred by the Trauma Unit--

513
00:33:15,201 --> 00:33:16,035
Huh?

514
00:33:16,619 --> 00:33:17,996
Over three hundred million?

515
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:21,207
We have to put a stop
to this kind of thing.

516
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:23,710
Only 300 million won?

517
00:33:23,793 --> 00:33:26,462
Our government funding can supplement
that amount, can't it?

518
00:33:32,218 --> 00:33:34,345
Man, this guy is just…

519
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:36,097
Yeah.

520
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:39,809
That funding is typically used for repairs
and the purchasing of our new equipment.

521
00:33:40,393 --> 00:33:44,188
Such funding is not to be used
to cover our losses like this.

522
00:33:44,272 --> 00:33:46,691
Yes, but it was originally
designed for that.

523
00:33:46,774 --> 00:33:48,276
Why not cover our losses with it?

524
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:52,655
On that note, why don't we review
the ICU's trauma unit?

525
00:33:52,739 --> 00:33:56,200
It's been the backup for the overflow
of patients from the main building.

526
00:33:56,284 --> 00:33:58,828
Even now, there are only
three beds available,

527
00:33:58,911 --> 00:34:01,664
and two of them are taken up
by other departments.

528
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:04,417
Hey, hey. All patients are given
equal treatment around here.

529
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,169
Are you serious?

530
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:10,423
If you're using funds for trauma patients
on other things,

531
00:34:10,506 --> 00:34:12,633
I think most people
would consider that fraud.

532
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:13,634
Whoa, whoa.

533
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:15,386
Yeah, well, if they audit us,

534
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:18,056
300 million won
will be the least of our worries.

535
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:20,516
We could be out billions
or even tens of billions.

536
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,769
Then you should stop overtreating
your patients.

537
00:34:22,852 --> 00:34:24,687
The attendings won't shut up
about funding.

538
00:34:24,771 --> 00:34:25,897
Hey! Watch yourself!

539
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:28,483
Your issue is that
you can't keep anything to yourself.

540
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:30,818
- You just have to say it!
- You better get used to it!

541
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:34,906
Now, as for our financial loss,

542
00:34:34,989 --> 00:34:36,824
I have no interest in your complaining.

543
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:39,202
I have patients that need saving,
so excuse me.

544
00:34:39,285 --> 00:34:40,369
Hey! Stop!

545
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:42,789
Oh! You better get back here right now!

546
00:34:42,872 --> 00:34:44,457
Yeah? Open the door. I dare you!

547
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:45,833
Hey, hey!

548
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:47,835
Hey, hey! You're gonna leave?

549
00:34:48,461 --> 00:34:49,712
Get back here!

550
00:34:49,796 --> 00:34:51,631
You son of a bitch! Come back here!

551
00:34:51,714 --> 00:34:53,049
Jesus Christ.

552
00:34:55,343 --> 00:34:56,344
Hey. Yu-rim?

553
00:34:56,427 --> 00:34:57,678
Yes. Yes, Jae-hun.

554
00:34:59,806 --> 00:35:01,849
That son of a bitch is tough.

555
00:35:02,725 --> 00:35:03,643
Real pain in the ass.

556
00:35:03,726 --> 00:35:04,811
Right?

557
00:35:04,894 --> 00:35:07,605
He's gonna keep making trouble.
We need an answer!

558
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:11,109
Do you think the board of directors
will stand for this loss?

559
00:35:13,027 --> 00:35:14,904
I could lose my shot as hospital director.

560
00:35:18,282 --> 00:35:21,828
You could lose out as future
director of planning and coordination.

561
00:35:23,746 --> 00:35:25,873
That… that can't happen.

562
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:27,792
Jae-hun, Jae-hun.

563
00:35:27,875 --> 00:35:30,002
Jae-hun. You leave it to me.

564
00:35:30,086 --> 00:35:31,712
Let me handle Dr. Baek.

565
00:35:32,213 --> 00:35:34,966
Everyone has skeletons
in their closet.

566
00:35:35,049 --> 00:35:36,801
Please just trust me on this one.

567
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,891
Hi, Dr. Yoon.

568
00:35:44,392 --> 00:35:45,476
Heard you were back.

569
00:35:46,644 --> 00:35:48,104
I think we should get dinner.

570
00:35:48,896 --> 00:35:49,730
Uh…

571
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:53,317
You were with
Doctors for International Peace, right?

572
00:35:54,068 --> 00:35:55,945
I have a favor to ask of you.

573
00:35:58,406 --> 00:36:00,908
{\an8}INTENSIVE CARE UNIT
NAME: LEE HYE-YEONG

574
00:36:16,883 --> 00:36:18,176
<i>Oh, Dr. Baek.</i>

575
00:36:18,885 --> 00:36:20,386
Is it gonna be okay?

576
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:22,805
The swelling will take a while.

577
00:36:23,306 --> 00:36:24,599
I think she'll be fine.

578
00:36:24,682 --> 00:36:26,517
- But we'll see.
- Uh…

579
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:28,102
I wasn't talking about that.

580
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:31,439
I'm talking about that meeting
you went to.

581
00:36:33,482 --> 00:36:35,526
Why are you so worried?
Keep your head down.

582
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:38,154
I know, but I'm worried about
the Trauma Unit.

583
00:36:38,237 --> 00:36:40,990
Hey, Anus. You have one mission in life.

584
00:36:41,073 --> 00:36:42,909
That is to take care of your patients.

585
00:36:42,992 --> 00:36:46,162
All this stuff about
our department's budget, it's unimportant.

586
00:36:47,705 --> 00:36:49,248
Yeah, all right.

587
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:57,590
So, anyway, let's get dinner.
It's my treat.

588
00:36:59,926 --> 00:37:01,260
- Get dinner?
- Yes.

589
00:37:02,803 --> 00:37:04,138
- At a restaurant?
- That's right.

590
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:05,890
Yes?

591
00:37:07,141 --> 00:37:09,977
Make sure that
you tell Gangster what I told you.

592
00:37:11,479 --> 00:37:12,730
Huh? About what?

593
00:37:16,442 --> 00:37:18,653
What did you say?

594
00:37:18,736 --> 00:37:21,155
<i>Yeah.</i>
<i>He wants you to come out looking human.</i>

595
00:37:24,158 --> 00:37:25,493
Yeah, all right. Fine.

596
00:37:26,619 --> 00:37:29,497
Ugh. I can't believe them.

597
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:32,250
Just because I don't get dressed up?
When I do dress up…

598
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:38,214
<i>It's good to be scared.</i>
<i>That means you still have something…</i>

599
00:37:38,297 --> 00:37:40,383
As long as I'm not naked, it's fine.

600
00:37:41,842 --> 00:37:43,928
What to wear?

601
00:37:45,304 --> 00:37:48,140
<i>But I'm scared too.</i>
<i>Do you understand?</i>

602
00:37:48,975 --> 00:37:50,851
These shows are so unrealistic.

603
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:53,020
Doctors are never that handsome.

604
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,216
- So hot!
- I know!

605
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:25,845
Dr. Baek! Dr. Baek!

606
00:38:25,928 --> 00:38:27,346
Oh God. Oh God.

607
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:30,474
So sorry I'm late.

608
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:31,809
Wow, Anus.

609
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,186
You clean up very nicely.

610
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:37,565
Actually, my colleagues know me
as someone who's well-dressed.

611
00:38:37,648 --> 00:38:40,151
I assume you're talking like this
'cause you're hungry.

612
00:38:41,527 --> 00:38:43,612
Actually, someone bought me
this whole outfit.

613
00:38:44,238 --> 00:38:45,573
Who's that? Girlfriend?

614
00:38:46,449 --> 00:38:48,326
And you don't seem like a mama's boy.

615
00:38:50,453 --> 00:38:51,829
Anyway, let's go.

616
00:38:52,371 --> 00:38:55,833
Who knows when we'll get an urgent call.
So we should enjoy ourselves.

617
00:38:56,375 --> 00:38:57,835
What are we eating anyway?

618
00:38:57,918 --> 00:38:59,670
Sushi? Beef?

619
00:39:00,963 --> 00:39:03,007
- Fried chicken?
- Oh boy.

620
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:09,055
{\an8}TRADITIONAL CHINESE CUISINE

621
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:15,853
Mmm!

622
00:39:18,981 --> 00:39:19,982
Have some food.

623
00:39:25,738 --> 00:39:29,116
I should've dressed a little nicer.
I'm close to home, so I dressed casually.

624
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:32,912
Well, clothes really don't matter
as long as you feel comfortable.

625
00:39:32,995 --> 00:39:35,998
Says the guy in, ooh, Prada. Oh!

626
00:39:36,082 --> 00:39:37,958
Looking good.

627
00:39:38,793 --> 00:39:40,878
Don't you think we ordered too much?

628
00:39:40,961 --> 00:39:42,755
The food here is really expensive.

629
00:39:42,838 --> 00:39:43,964
Hmm? I've got money.

630
00:39:44,048 --> 00:39:46,050
Mm. Were you born rich?

631
00:39:46,133 --> 00:39:48,344
Were you born into riches?

632
00:39:48,427 --> 00:39:49,261
Hmm?

633
00:39:50,554 --> 00:39:51,680
I'm the rich one.

634
00:39:51,764 --> 00:39:53,766
My parents passed away young.

635
00:39:55,142 --> 00:39:57,436
Sorry, I shouldn't have… brought it up.

636
00:39:58,020 --> 00:39:59,688
It's fine. It doesn't bother me.

637
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:06,612
Oh, that's right. Compassion.

638
00:40:08,447 --> 00:40:12,326
It might not be the ideal moment
to bring this up, but now that we have…

639
00:40:13,202 --> 00:40:16,622
My mom died when I was very young,
so I have no memories of her.

640
00:40:16,705 --> 00:40:18,499
And my father worked as a cleaner.

641
00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:21,710
One morning, as he was driving to work,

642
00:40:21,794 --> 00:40:23,337
he got into a car accident.

643
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:25,756
He was so severely injured by it

644
00:40:26,507 --> 00:40:28,509
that none of the hospitals
would treat him.

645
00:40:29,009 --> 00:40:30,177
Eventually,

646
00:40:30,886 --> 00:40:34,140
he died at the very last hospital
that he arrived at.

647
00:40:36,767 --> 00:40:37,977
That's why I'm a doctor.

648
00:40:45,484 --> 00:40:47,236
That was my sob story.

649
00:40:47,319 --> 00:40:48,779
That's not what I meant when I--

650
00:40:48,863 --> 00:40:50,865
If you won't eat,
I'll eat everything.

651
00:40:50,948 --> 00:40:53,742
Wait. We're going to eat too.
Eat up, Dr. Yang.

652
00:40:53,826 --> 00:40:54,660
Okay.

653
00:40:57,872 --> 00:41:01,083
Oh, that's right.
I'm curious about one thing.

654
00:41:02,751 --> 00:41:03,627
Your tattoo.

655
00:41:03,711 --> 00:41:05,463
This is just, mm…

656
00:41:05,546 --> 00:41:08,090
They said it would
keep me out of harm's way.

657
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:09,884
Huh?

658
00:41:09,967 --> 00:41:12,178
I've run through countless war zones.

659
00:41:13,512 --> 00:41:14,763
And I've never been shot.

660
00:41:25,107 --> 00:41:25,983
Just cover me!

661
00:41:45,002 --> 00:41:47,087
<i>Hmm. Syria, huh?</i>

662
00:41:47,671 --> 00:41:49,840
When you were in
Doctors for International Peace?

663
00:41:49,924 --> 00:41:51,550
Well, something like that. Yeah.

664
00:41:52,051 --> 00:41:52,885
Mm.

665
00:41:52,968 --> 00:41:54,970
Is that when you learned
to fly a helicopter?

666
00:41:55,596 --> 00:41:57,765
Do doctors in Syria
fly the helicopters themselves?

667
00:41:57,848 --> 00:41:59,642
I have an important announcement.

668
00:42:01,393 --> 00:42:03,020
Anus, this is about you.

669
00:42:03,103 --> 00:42:04,897
You're part of trauma surgery now.

670
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:06,815
And it feels wrong
to keep calling you "Anus."

671
00:42:07,691 --> 00:42:09,443
Yes, you're right. It's wrong.

672
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:10,819
So I thought

673
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:12,655
I would…

674
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,452
stop calling you Anus from now on.

675
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:21,872
How about instead…

676
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:24,917
…"Number One"?

677
00:42:26,418 --> 00:42:27,670
- "One"?
- Yes.

678
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:30,965
Like… Protégé One?

679
00:42:31,048 --> 00:42:32,174
Napkin.

680
00:42:32,258 --> 00:42:33,300
Sure.

681
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:37,012
No, not protégé.

682
00:42:37,513 --> 00:42:38,347
Slave One.

683
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:44,019
Ah, no way. No way.

684
00:42:44,103 --> 00:42:46,939
Just use my real name. My real name!

685
00:42:48,148 --> 00:42:50,693
- Hmm.
- Hey, Number One. Answer that.

686
00:42:55,739 --> 00:42:57,491
EMERGENCY ROOM, HNUH

687
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:01,328
This is Yang Jae-won speaking.

688
00:43:03,872 --> 00:43:04,748
Huh?

689
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:08,502
Pedestrian traffic accident.

690
00:43:09,503 --> 00:43:11,005
Tell 'em we'll be there in ten minutes.

691
00:43:11,088 --> 00:43:12,214
We're coming right now.

692
00:43:12,298 --> 00:43:14,925
- Oh, I'll come too.
- No. It's your day off.

693
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:17,428
Hmm.

694
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:21,974
All right.

695
00:43:23,475 --> 00:43:24,518
It's my day off.

696
00:43:28,188 --> 00:43:30,983
I wanted to say this earlier,
but I'll keep it short for now.

697
00:43:31,066 --> 00:43:34,361
Gangster. I think you're
seriously mistaken about something.

698
00:43:34,445 --> 00:43:37,406
Fights are about winning,
not about protection.

699
00:43:37,489 --> 00:43:39,033
So I will win.

700
00:43:40,909 --> 00:43:42,494
Finish up before you come.

701
00:43:45,998 --> 00:43:47,791
What is he saying?

702
00:43:49,168 --> 00:43:50,419
I can't finish this.

703
00:43:50,502 --> 00:43:52,171
Uh! Uh, uh, taxi!

704
00:43:52,254 --> 00:43:54,798
- Hey, hey, hey! Number One! Hang on.
- Taxi, taxi, taxi, taxi! Huh?

705
00:43:55,507 --> 00:43:56,550
Let's make it five.

706
00:43:56,634 --> 00:43:59,053
Hey, we need to borrow that.

707
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:04,141
CHINESE DELIVERY

708
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,087
Dr. Baek, 34 minutes since we began CPR.

709
00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:34,088
Clear.

710
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:36,965
Shock.

711
00:44:55,317 --> 00:44:56,402
Stop it.

712
00:44:58,070 --> 00:44:58,987
Take a break.

713
00:45:17,589 --> 00:45:18,841
Phone the next of kin.

714
00:45:19,967 --> 00:45:21,051
It's too late.

715
00:45:28,225 --> 00:45:29,810
It's not your fault, Dr. Baek.

716
00:45:30,978 --> 00:45:32,855
The cervical vertebra was broken.

717
00:45:33,355 --> 00:45:34,940
Their skull is crushed as well.

718
00:45:38,527 --> 00:45:40,279
If we'd gotten here faster…

719
00:45:41,739 --> 00:45:43,449
It would have been the same.

720
00:45:45,075 --> 00:45:47,995
Dr. Baek, you… you can't save
every single one.

721
00:45:55,002 --> 00:45:56,503
Fall victim incoming!

722
00:45:57,087 --> 00:45:58,255
Hey, make way.

723
00:46:23,363 --> 00:46:25,574
Prep an OR! And hurry!

724
00:47:14,456 --> 00:47:15,624
Dr. Baek!

725
00:47:29,388 --> 00:47:36,395
