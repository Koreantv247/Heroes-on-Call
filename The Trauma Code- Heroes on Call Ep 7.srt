00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:10,737
THE TRAUMA CODE: HEROES ON CALL

2
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:16,576
<i>We have orders</i>
<i>to restrict Dr. Baek Kang-hyuk</i>

3
00:01:16,659 --> 00:01:18,161
<i>from entering the premises.</i>

4
00:01:19,162 --> 00:01:20,789
For now, let us through.

5
00:01:20,872 --> 00:01:23,875
You can confirm all this again later.
Move aside. Move aside!

6
00:01:23,958 --> 00:01:25,710
Come on, please. Please! Please!

7
00:01:25,794 --> 00:01:28,296
- Just move!
- Number One.

8
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:33,134
Do whatever you need to do and get a CT.

9
00:01:33,635 --> 00:01:35,095
You can go inside. Right?

10
00:01:35,178 --> 00:01:36,471
Me? Me?

11
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,516
- Dr. Baek, hold on.
- Dr. Baek!

12
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:43,144
Wait, Dr. Baek. We could get a CT.
What about the surgery?

13
00:01:44,896 --> 00:01:46,106
Dr. Baek.

14
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:49,400
BP is dropping. 50 over 30!

15
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:52,987
Dr. Yang.

16
00:01:58,284 --> 00:01:59,119
Uh…

17
00:02:00,203 --> 00:02:01,830
- Oh…
- So what do we do?

18
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:04,916
- Dr. Jae-won.
- Can you hear me? Can you hear me?

19
00:02:04,999 --> 00:02:06,042
Can you hear me?

20
00:02:09,337 --> 00:02:10,213
Just a minute.

21
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:13,133
- Just wait. I just need a moment.
- Dr. Jae-won.

22
00:02:21,766 --> 00:02:24,102
Dr. Jae-won. You need to focus!

23
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:31,693
Doctor, what do we do?

24
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:46,624
Let's go. Let's get the CT.

25
00:02:48,626 --> 00:02:49,752
Right.

26
00:02:51,796 --> 00:02:52,672
Move aside.

27
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:56,718
Get outta my way!

28
00:02:58,678 --> 00:02:59,762
Let 'em through.

29
00:03:05,935 --> 00:03:08,730
Uh, I'll call you back. Hi, Dr. Baek.

30
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:11,274
What, what, what, what, what?

31
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:14,444
Director Hong stripped me
of my medical privileges.

32
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:17,572
Oh, that. Yes, I heard about that.

33
00:03:17,655 --> 00:03:18,990
It wasn't malpractice.

34
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:21,534
But that's just… It's hospital policy.

35
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:24,120
Hospital policies dictate

36
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:27,207
that, wherever possible,
patients should be assessed on-site.

37
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:29,459
So whatever bullshit
Director Hong is saying,

38
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:33,588
that can, in fact, be overruled
by you as the head of emergency medicine

39
00:03:33,671 --> 00:03:35,590
or by the director of
the emergency center.

40
00:03:35,673 --> 00:03:36,799
Isn't that right?

41
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:40,803
We don't have much time. Let's go.

42
00:03:50,813 --> 00:03:52,106
Call emergency medicine!

43
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:54,859
- Tell them they may have to resuscitate!
- Yes, sir.

44
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:56,110
<i>Listen, Dr. Im.</i>

45
00:03:56,861 --> 00:03:59,906
You don't wanna stop having
the lowest fatality rate in the country.

46
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:03,034
Isn't that why you agreed
to provide the trauma department

47
00:04:03,117 --> 00:04:05,286
with staff from emergency medicine?

48
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:06,829
Huh?

49
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:10,833
<i>Code Blue. Code Blue.</i>
<i>Emergency center CT room.</i>

50
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:14,712
<i>Code Blue. Code Blue.</i>
<i>Emergency center CT room.</i>

51
00:04:15,546 --> 00:04:16,756
So choose wisely.

52
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:19,592
If you don't open the operating room
right now,

53
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,595
you'll be responsible
for that patient's death.

54
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:27,600
His blood pressure
is still unstable.

55
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:30,353
{\an8}Hartmann's solution.
It's a good thing you connected that.

56
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:32,689
{\an8}His blood pressure
would've gone out of control.

57
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:36,276
Oh. Dr. Baek.

58
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:40,113
How is it looking?

59
00:04:40,196 --> 00:04:42,824
Contrast agent went in.
We're scanning the neck and chest.

60
00:04:42,907 --> 00:04:46,119
That embedded knife blade is still being
pushed further in with each breath.

61
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:53,334
What the…
The contrast is leaking.

62
00:04:54,085 --> 00:04:56,379
- It's a rupture. Move.
- Huh? Okay.

63
00:04:57,338 --> 00:04:58,673
Need pressure on the carotid.

64
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:03,177
What do we do?

65
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:04,804
I have it for now.

66
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:08,224
We'll flush the central vein with saline
and begin surgery.

67
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:09,309
Yes, Dr. Baek.

68
00:05:13,896 --> 00:05:16,441
Dr. Baek.
The knife is poking at the aorta.

69
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:20,945
- Hong, call anesthesiology.
- They're already here.

70
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:23,031
- What?
- Anesthetics is ready.

71
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:25,450
Dr. Gyeong-won, how did you…

72
00:05:25,533 --> 00:05:28,494
I knew Dr. Baek would do
whatever it took to get into surgery.

73
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:30,705
That's why you prepared
everything too, right?

74
00:05:30,788 --> 00:05:33,916
{\an8}The devices are laid out.
We're setting up a cardiopulmonary bypass.

75
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:37,754
Okay. Okay. Dr. Baek will be here soon.

76
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:40,298
This patient's a difficult one.
So give it your all.

77
00:05:40,381 --> 00:05:41,799
Yes, ma'am.

78
00:05:47,096 --> 00:05:49,557
I never imagined this.

79
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,683
Are you sure?

80
00:05:51,267 --> 00:05:52,894
Yeah. Don't believe me?

81
00:05:53,394 --> 00:05:55,938
My ear is always to the ground
when it comes to stuff like this.

82
00:05:57,774 --> 00:06:01,152
For Dr. Baek, I think this is gonna be
the final nail in the coffin.

83
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:04,614
Oh. Dr. Han.

84
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:07,075
Dr. Baek did something wrong?

85
00:06:08,242 --> 00:06:09,327
You didn't know?

86
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:10,828
Why else would I be asking?

87
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:12,246
What is it?

88
00:06:12,955 --> 00:06:14,290
Ah, well…

89
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:18,795
<i>You know how Dr. Baek bored into</i>
<i>that patient's skull in the ambulance?</i>

90
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:21,881
<i>Well, apparently, the hospital</i>
<i>ruled that as malpractice.</i>

91
00:06:21,964 --> 00:06:25,218
<i>So there are a bunch of reporters</i>
<i>swarming around the place right now.</i>

92
00:06:28,679 --> 00:06:31,599
This is… a big deal…

93
00:06:31,682 --> 00:06:34,227
INVESTIGATION BRIEFING
ON DR. BAEK KANG-HYUK'S MALPRACTICE

94
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:38,189
The hospital is going to step forward
and reveal this malpractice

95
00:06:38,272 --> 00:06:39,816
'cause our reputation is at stake.

96
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:42,151
Baek Kang-hyuk can take
all the blame on his own.

97
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:46,697
Do we really need to
raise the stakes to this level?

98
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:49,826
Director Choi, sir.
Please. Now is not the time to be soft.

99
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:52,453
Baek Kang-hyuk has
the full support of Minister Kang.

100
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:54,664
If we want her to cut ties,
we have to raise the stakes.

101
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:58,709
She forced us to hire one of her cronies,

102
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:00,628
and it led to a patient's death.

103
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:02,088
Exactly.

104
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:05,925
I like it.

105
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:11,973
SURGERY IN PROGRESS

106
00:07:12,056 --> 00:07:14,725
{\an8}It could stab the heart.
We need to get rid of it.

107
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:15,643
{\an8}Yes, sir.

108
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:17,937
{\an8}- Bypass on.
- Bypass on.

109
00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:20,565
- Flow down.
- Flow down.

110
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:23,860
- ACC on.
- ACC on.

111
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:27,196
Flow back up.

112
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,823
Flow back up.

113
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:32,452
Cardiopulmonary bypass setup
is complete.

114
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:34,036
Get the knife out first.

115
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,079
Okay.

116
00:07:35,663 --> 00:07:37,790
I'll push,
and you can pull from the top.

117
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:56,309
{\an8}Gangster, we have a stock of
artificial blood vessels, don't we?

118
00:07:56,392 --> 00:07:59,562
{\an8}No, they're a high-value item, so we need
to get them from the central supply room.

119
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:02,315
{\an8}- Run there and ask for one.
- Yes, sir.

120
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:12,241
Tray, please.

121
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:16,496
Number One.

122
00:08:17,121 --> 00:08:18,372
Aren't you gonna run?

123
00:08:19,123 --> 00:08:19,957
Right.

124
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:25,922
Out of the way! Move, move, move!

125
00:08:27,131 --> 00:08:29,675
Whoa! I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Coming through!

126
00:08:35,431 --> 00:08:37,475
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

127
00:08:40,978 --> 00:08:43,648
Jesus Christ!
How is she so fast?

128
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:46,526
CENTRAL SUPPLY ROOM

129
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:48,611
No, I'm sorry.

130
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:49,612
Hey, listen!

131
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:53,074
We need an artificial blood vessel,
or this guy's gonna die!

132
00:08:53,157 --> 00:08:55,326
How do you know that? You're not a doctor.

133
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:01,749
Doctor. Doctor.

134
00:09:01,832 --> 00:09:03,334
- Yeah!
- Yes, I'm a doctor.

135
00:09:03,417 --> 00:09:05,253
We need an artificial blood vessel.

136
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:07,505
You heard him! Give it to us right now!

137
00:09:07,588 --> 00:09:11,217
High-value items can only be released
with Director Choi's written approval.

138
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:14,845
Are you kidding me? A life is on the line,
and you want the director's approval?

139
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:17,056
- Just give it to us.
- There are rules for a reason.

140
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:19,433
There's only one way now.

141
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:22,019
Doctor, we should… do things our way.

142
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:24,188
Hey! Where do you think you're going?

143
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:26,315
Whoa!

144
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:28,609
Hey. Open this door.

145
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:31,946
Apologies, but we're desperate right now.
Let's find the blood vessel.

146
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:33,531
What are you doing?

147
00:09:33,614 --> 00:09:35,575
- Start over here.
- Where is it?

148
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:37,743
- Uh, uh…
- It's not here.

149
00:09:40,496 --> 00:09:42,123
Oh! Oh!

150
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:44,041
Here they are.

151
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:45,209
- What?
- Found it.

152
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:46,752
- Hurry!
- Uh, okay!

153
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:50,298
- Stop! You thieves!
- I'll take it. I'm faster!

154
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:52,633
Get back here now!

155
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:54,302
Stop running!

156
00:10:00,891 --> 00:10:02,351
{\an8}Hey, wait for me!

157
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:04,979
{\an8}Wait for me, Nurse Jang-mi.

158
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:10,067
Hey, hey.

159
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:11,861
- You scared me!
- Yang Jae-won. Yang Jae-won.

160
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:13,613
Dr. Baek. Where is he right now?

161
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:14,572
- Dr. Baek?
- Yeah.

162
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:17,283
- In surgery right now.
- Hey, hey, we're in big trouble.

163
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:19,118
Hong Jae-hun's holding a press conference.

164
00:10:19,201 --> 00:10:20,953
- Yeah? So what?
- So what?

165
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:23,706
I think he's on a mission
to bring Dr. Baek down!

166
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,131
Dr. Baek! Dr. Baek.

167
00:10:32,214 --> 00:10:34,342
You took your sweet time
getting back.

168
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:38,137
They're holding a press conference
at two o'clock.

169
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,723
That patient from Bukhansan.

170
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:43,017
Director Hong is calling it
a malpractice case.

171
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:45,061
There are reporters here and everything.

172
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:47,146
It begins in 25 minutes.

173
00:10:47,229 --> 00:10:48,689
If we don't do something,

174
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:50,858
it'll look like we're accepting
their verdict.

175
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:51,859
So what?

176
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:54,737
- Sir?
- What about it?

177
00:10:55,529 --> 00:10:57,907
Should we abandon this patient
to go to a press conference?

178
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:59,200
We need to stop them.

179
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:02,036
- It wasn't malpractice.
- Hurry and scrub in.

180
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:03,954
I'm going to use this
to replace the aorta.

181
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:06,207
- Dr. Baek, you can't.
- Shut up and scrub in.

182
00:11:06,874 --> 00:11:08,501
The patient is the priority.

183
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:33,734
I need to do something.

184
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:35,528
I should, yeah.

185
00:11:38,155 --> 00:11:39,407
My child

186
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:42,660
is lying in a coma right now.

187
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:46,205
He's only 20 years old!

188
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:50,000
What did he do
to deserve any of this?

189
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:56,924
I hope that the truth comes out today

190
00:11:57,007 --> 00:12:00,177
so that this kind of tragedy
never occurs again.

191
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:19,405
- Dr. Baek, you know--
- Get on with the sutures.

192
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:27,413
You kept that patient under observation,
didn't you?

193
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:29,623
You need to do something
right now, Doctor!

194
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:32,668
Unfortunately, I don't think I can help
with anything here.

195
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:34,670
I was brought on
after his initial treatment.

196
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:37,882
I know that. Dr. Baek was only trying
to save the patient.

197
00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:41,218
He put in so much effort to save him.
Come on. Help him out here.

198
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:42,470
Here's what you should do.

199
00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:45,806
Just find evidence that his treatment
was appropriate to the situation.

200
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:49,393
- Meet with other trauma specialists.
- You're saying you won't do anything?!

201
00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:52,062
- Dr. Han.
- You couldn't help me out just this once?!

202
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:54,774
You saw the chart. He did the right thing!

203
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:57,568
<i>Well, I wouldn't have</i>
<i>cracked his skull in that situation.</i>

204
00:12:57,651 --> 00:13:00,988
Dr. Kim, just because you can't do it
doesn't mean it's wrong!

205
00:13:01,071 --> 00:13:03,824
Dr. Hwang, listen.
Now, please, don't get offended.

206
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:05,159
All I'm saying…

207
00:13:05,242 --> 00:13:06,827
<i>How will you prove it though?</i>

208
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:09,497
<i>"Dr. Baek can do it."</i>
<i>That's your only argument?</i>

209
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:11,916
I get it.

210
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,460
One more question.

211
00:13:14,543 --> 00:13:16,462
What if it were your son, Dr. Jung?

212
00:13:17,254 --> 00:13:18,714
What would you have done, then?

213
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:21,842
<i>Jesus. Well, I would've done it</i>
<i>as a last-ditch effort, sure.</i>

214
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:23,552
Yes.

215
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:24,720
That's right.

216
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:27,431
Can't you tell them exactly that?

217
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:31,268
<i>But, Dr. Han. Director Hong has already</i>
<i>contacted everyone.</i>

218
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:32,353
Sorry, what?

219
00:13:33,687 --> 00:13:35,064
The hospital has decided

220
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:40,569
to engage in a thorough investigation
to get to the bottom of this.

221
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:43,948
We are going to leave no stone unturned

222
00:13:44,031 --> 00:13:46,325
in a serious case of malpractice
like this.

223
00:13:48,577 --> 00:13:49,537
Right here…

224
00:13:51,455 --> 00:13:54,333
are letters from prominent trauma surgeons
sharing their views.

225
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:58,379
Dr. Baek Kang-hyuk's treatment
was medically irresponsible.

226
00:13:58,462 --> 00:14:01,799
This is objective evidence of malpractice.

227
00:14:04,593 --> 00:14:07,137
This is wrong. This is so wrong.

228
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:09,557
That piece of shit has
really crossed the line!

229
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:11,350
Hong Jae-hun.

230
00:14:11,433 --> 00:14:14,019
I will… I will expose you to the world.

231
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:33,622
<i>Dr. Baek Kang-hyuk was more</i>
<i>interested in flaunting his abilities.</i>

232
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:35,416
<i>He committed an act of arrogance,</i>

233
00:14:35,499 --> 00:14:38,502
<i>which is anathema</i>
<i>to our hospital's standards.</i>

234
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:41,505
Countless medical professionals,
including our hospital director…

235
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:42,506
He's really screwed.

236
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:45,467
…have already expressed
their concerns several times.

237
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:47,344
His only interest is
bettering his reputation.

238
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:48,554
You're so fucked!

239
00:14:48,637 --> 00:14:52,182
Unfortunately, Kang-hyuk's greed
could not be stopped.

240
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:54,727
- Coming through.
- Tragic events are inexcusable.

241
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:57,313
They cannot be allowed
to occur at our hosp--

242
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:00,399
Isn't that Baek Kang-hyuk?

243
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,651
What the hell?

244
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:10,951
What are you doing here?!
How dare you show your face here! Get out!

245
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:11,994
Ma'am.

246
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:14,079
- Just a minute.
- Hey, it's all right.

247
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:15,706
Let go.

248
00:15:15,789 --> 00:15:18,042
Please just hear us out, ma'am. Please.

249
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:25,549
I am Baek Kang-hyuk.
May I have your attention?

250
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:27,217
What do you think you're doing?

251
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:29,511
This is not a case of malpractice.

252
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:30,763
What are you doing?

253
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,098
Please read this.

254
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:37,269
Don't we have security?
Hey, get the security team!

255
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:38,562
Pass them back.

256
00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:42,274
In order to prove that
my treatment method was perfectly correct,

257
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:45,778
I'm sharing the details of another patient
who was in the same condition.

258
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:47,404
OPERATIVE REPORT

259
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:54,078
We were in a helicopter
when we bore into his skull.

260
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:55,663
But he's not in a coma.

261
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:04,254
He received the same treatment
for the same condition and survived,

262
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:06,882
and that's because
it was inside the golden hour.

263
00:16:07,883 --> 00:16:09,802
And the reason is that we flew there.

264
00:16:09,885 --> 00:16:11,720
Whereas in this case, we had to drive.

265
00:16:19,186 --> 00:16:20,646
And so he fell into a coma.

266
00:16:21,855 --> 00:16:23,482
On that day,

267
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:26,402
we learned all of the helicopters
were grounded.

268
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:32,866
Are you saying the National Rescue Unit
is responsible, then?

269
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:34,994
No, no. Of course not.

270
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:38,288
Someone else is responsible for this mess.

271
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:39,707
Who is it?

272
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:43,961
I'm going to use
this opportunity today

273
00:16:44,044 --> 00:16:48,340
to name the one
who actually grounded the helicopters.

274
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:52,803
Fire commissioner?

275
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:54,722
Uh…

276
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:57,266
You're saying it's not true
that you require an official request

277
00:16:57,349 --> 00:16:59,977
in order for helicopters
to be deployed, right?

278
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:00,936
Minister.

279
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:02,896
It was a mistake.

280
00:17:03,772 --> 00:17:05,149
A mistake?

281
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:07,985
Yeah? Well then, whose mistake was it?!

282
00:17:08,485 --> 00:17:09,486
<i>Director Hong.</i>

283
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:13,157
He's right here.

284
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:19,371
Just what the hell
are you talking about?

285
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:21,415
Do you have any evidence?

286
00:17:21,498 --> 00:17:25,502
The fire commissioner is stepping down.
A police investigation will also begin.

287
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:30,591
Everybody, these are all complete lies.
Everything he's saying is false.

288
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:34,178
I have… always had
the patient's best interest at heart--

289
00:17:34,261 --> 00:17:36,638
What? Best interest?

290
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:39,141
You really could say that
in front of Kim Dong-seok?

291
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:40,934
- Who the hell is that?
- Unbelievable.

292
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:42,311
Yeah! Just who is that?!

293
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:43,604
Kim Dong-seok.

294
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:53,572
That's my son!

295
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:08,796
Stop it! Stop this!

296
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:10,255
- Move aside!
- Director Hong.

297
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:12,466
Move aside, Jesus Christ!

298
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:13,675
Director Hong.

299
00:18:20,682 --> 00:18:22,601
Everyone,
if you could spare a moment?

300
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:26,814
This incident

301
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:30,109
resulted from hostile interests
trying to stop our helicopter use

302
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:32,528
all in order to reduce
the hospital's deficit.

303
00:18:33,987 --> 00:18:37,991
How much longer will money be allowed
to decide the fate of our patients?

304
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:41,995
Are we going to let money
be the reason patients suffer,

305
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:43,789
even when treatment is available?

306
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:47,000
And how much longer must the trauma center

307
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:50,337
be treated like sinners
who caused the budget deficit?

308
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:56,051
I can put up with
being blamed for everything.

309
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,805
But what I cannot put up with…

310
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:11,400
…is patients are the ones

311
00:19:12,734 --> 00:19:16,488
who wind up having
to shoulder the consequences.

312
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:46,185
Hankuk National University Hospital
Director of Planning and Coordination,

313
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:50,147
Hong Jae-hun, who allegedly
restricted the use of a rescue helicopter,

314
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:51,481
resulting in a trauma patient…

315
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:53,692
It's him! It's him!
He's here!

316
00:19:56,737 --> 00:19:58,780
Sir? Sir! Sir!

317
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:01,700
- Director Hong!
- Director Hong, please.

318
00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:03,911
This way, Director.

319
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:13,837
Would you like to make a comment?
Please say a few words.

320
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:15,172
I am innocent!

321
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:21,470
Baek Kang-hyuk has already caused
a lot of issues for the hospital

322
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:24,264
through his own arrogance and his pride!

323
00:20:24,848 --> 00:20:26,808
And the reason he was allowed to

324
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:28,393
is because he

325
00:20:29,102 --> 00:20:32,981
is backed by the Minister of Health
and Welfare, Kang Myeong-hui.

326
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:35,734
{\an8}<i>Baek Kang-hyuk</i>

327
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:40,572
{\an8}<i>is just the Minister's crony</i>
<i>who was sent here to spy on us!</i>

328
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:44,910
You can't acknowledge it, Minister.
This is ridiculous.

329
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:47,496
How about this?

330
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:50,290
"I was introduced to him
through Chilseong Hospital."

331
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:51,375
What do you think of that?

332
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:52,960
<i>The allegations of cronyism,</i>

333
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:55,420

00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:05,472
Office of the Minister of Health

338
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:08,267
No, we will not be providing a statement.

339
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:11,436
Right. An official statement
will be released soon.

340
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,605
An official statement
will be released soon.

341
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:14,606
I'm hanging up.

342
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:17,985
Office of the Minister of Health
and Welfare. No comment--

343
00:21:19,569 --> 00:21:20,529
Pardon?

344
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:24,825
"Future presidential candidate
Minister Kang Myeong-hui

345
00:21:24,908 --> 00:21:26,076
faces career hiccup."

346
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:28,453
No mention of malpractice.

347
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:31,081
Seems like now
they're talking about cronyism.

348
00:21:31,164 --> 00:21:33,750
Things are getting more serious now, huh?

349
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:36,211
Baek Kang-hyuk,
shouldn't you say something?

350
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:38,005
Why should I? Kang should do it.

351
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:39,214
The Minister?

352
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:40,882
Why would she do it?

353
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:43,343
She's a master of politics. Hmm?

354
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:46,972
Rather than give a half-assed explanation,

355
00:21:47,055 --> 00:21:48,265
she'd tell the truth.

356
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:51,935
What? You think she'll actually admit
to appointing a crony?

357
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:55,605
Wow, you really are clueless
when it comes to politics, aren't you?

358
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:57,607
You sugarcoat the truth.

359
00:21:58,442 --> 00:22:00,193
Just like this dumpling right here.

360
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:01,862
Really?

361
00:22:02,446 --> 00:22:03,363
How about this?

362
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:07,534
"We wanted to recruit someone
who was anti-establishment."

363
00:22:07,617 --> 00:22:08,577
That's better.

364
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:11,204
Ah…

365
00:22:12,205 --> 00:22:13,332
Is that all?

366
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:15,792
Mm.

367
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:18,253
Hmm. It's the Minister.

368
00:22:21,381 --> 00:22:22,924
This is Baek Kang-hyuk.

369
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:24,926
<i>Dr. Baek. Put the news on.</i>

370
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:25,927
The news?

371
00:22:27,262 --> 00:22:28,221
News.

372
00:22:29,222 --> 00:22:30,682
{\an8}<i>Now to breaking news.</i>

373
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:33,477
{\an8}<i>The Hanbit Unit, which is currently</i>
<i>deployed in South Sudan,</i>

374
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:35,687
{\an8}<i>has been involved in a shooting,</i>
<i>reports say.</i>

375
00:22:36,271 --> 00:22:39,232
<i>Eleven members of</i>
<i>the Doctors for International Peace,</i>

376
00:22:39,316 --> 00:22:42,569
<i>who were engaged in relief</i>
<i>and medical activities in South Sudan,</i>

377
00:22:42,652 --> 00:22:46,323
<i>were almost kidnapped by a local militia</i>
<i>when soldiers of the Hanbit Unit,</i>

378
00:22:46,406 --> 00:22:48,700
<i>who had been dispatched</i>
<i>to work with the UN</i>

379
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:52,537
<i>and were working on a road nearby,</i>
<i>engaged in a rescue operation.</i>

380
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:57,042
<i>Our soldiers killed three rebels</i>
<i>from the militia.</i>

381
00:22:57,125 --> 00:22:58,585
<i>However, in the process,</i>

382
00:22:58,668 --> 00:23:01,755
<i>Captain Lee Hyeon-jong of</i>
<i>the Hanbit Unit was shot.</i>

383
00:23:01,838 --> 00:23:04,341
<i>He is now reported to be</i>
<i>in critical condition.</i>

384
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:09,096
<i>Captain Lee Hyeon-jong</i>
<i>was rushed to a local hospital.</i>

385
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:13,600
<i>But according to military sources,</i>
<i>his chances of recovery remain uncertain.</i>

386
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:16,478
<i>We need your help, Dr. Baek.</i>

387
00:23:17,145 --> 00:23:19,398
I need you
to make your way there immediately

388
00:23:19,481 --> 00:23:21,316
to treat Captain Lee Hyeon-jong.

389
00:23:21,983 --> 00:23:22,984
Doctor.

390
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:27,989
Right now, they're portraying you and I
as symbols of crony corruption.

391
00:23:28,949 --> 00:23:30,367
Let's face that head-on.

392
00:23:32,702 --> 00:23:34,788
I agree.

393
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:39,751
Wait, seriously?

394
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:41,169
You're actually going?

395
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:45,173
I'm the gunshot wound expert, so who else?
Take care of the trauma center.

396
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:48,468
Huh? You want me? Really?

397
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:50,137
You're the head of general surgery.

398
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:52,597
If not you,
then the head of internal medicine?

399
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:55,517
Well, no, that's not right.
But I'm not right for it.

400
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,686
Either way, get the surgical staff ready.

401
00:23:58,270 --> 00:23:59,146
And do your best.

402
00:23:59,229 --> 00:24:01,189
Oh boy.

403
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:02,732
I'm all ready to go.

404
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:04,359
Oh, good.

405
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:06,903
Wait, let me think, let me think.

406
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:10,407
- I have a nurse and an assistant doctor.
- Mm-hmm.

407
00:24:11,908 --> 00:24:13,410
With one spare seat.

408
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:21,501
CAPTAIN LEE HYEON-JONG SHOT AND INJURED

409
00:24:22,544 --> 00:24:24,254
Park Gyeong-won, let's go.

410
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:48,778
<i>I heard you hand-selected</i>
<i>the best team for the job.</i>

411
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:53,200
<i>I've requested support from the airport</i>
<i>and on the ground in South Sudan,</i>

412
00:24:53,283 --> 00:24:56,161
<i>so you should have no trouble</i>
<i>completing your mission.</i>

413
00:24:56,244 --> 00:25:00,165
<i>Please save Captain Lee Hyeon-jong</i>
<i>and make a safe return home.</i>

414
00:25:02,959 --> 00:25:06,213
<i>I trust you completely, Dr. Baek,</i>
<i>and will await your return.</i>

415
00:25:20,727 --> 00:25:23,438
2 SHOTS, RIGHT ARM, HUMERUS FRACTURE
1 SHOT, LEFT ARM, RADIUS/ULNA FRACTURE

416
00:25:25,565 --> 00:25:28,735
So it looks like he took two shots
in the right arm.

417
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:39,871
<i>Three times in the abdomen.</i>

418
00:25:40,747 --> 00:25:42,707
<i>Two of which were through and through.</i>

419
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:45,585
<i>The last one is still lodged inside.</i>

420
00:25:50,173 --> 00:25:53,009
<i>One in the left arm.</i>
<i>This one's lodged inside too.</i>

421
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:01,643
<i>Will he still be alive</i>
<i>by the time I get there?</i>

422
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:08,024
I'm gonna pray. It's been a while.

423
00:26:10,026 --> 00:26:11,027
Lord…

424
00:26:14,114 --> 00:26:15,323
you can count on me.

425
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:29,504
{\an8}<i>Dr. Baek,</i>
<i>I thought this was a direct flight?</i>

426
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:31,548
{\an8}<i>Is this</i>
<i>your first trip to South Sudan?</i>

427
00:26:31,631 --> 00:26:34,050
{\an8}<i>This is the first time</i>
<i>my passport has been stamped.</i>

428
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:55,030
MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND WELFARE

429
00:26:55,113 --> 00:26:57,699
REQUESTING MEDICAL AID
FOR HANBIT UNIT IN SOUTH SUDAN

430
00:27:01,244 --> 00:27:02,495
What is all this about?

431
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:04,331
Where did Baek Kang-hyuk go?

432
00:27:04,414 --> 00:27:05,957
To South Sudan.

433
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:08,293
And why am I just now hearing about this?!

434
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:11,921
The official request for our cooperation
only just arrived.

435
00:27:12,005 --> 00:27:14,424
It looks like the Ministry of Defense
requested it.

436
00:27:14,507 --> 00:27:16,926
- So Minister Kang made it happen.
- No way!

437
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:18,637
Stop them right now!

438
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,639
Wait, no. I'll go myself. I'll go.

439
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:24,684
Uh…

440
00:27:25,435 --> 00:27:26,811
Madam Minister.

441
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:29,314
Hello there.

442
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:37,364
This concerns Dr. Baek.

443
00:27:37,947 --> 00:27:39,991
Yes. I received the report.

444
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:42,077
No, that's not the real issue.

445
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:46,122
I wanted to get to the bottom of all this.

446
00:27:48,291 --> 00:27:52,837
Now how could you just, uh,
use your deficit as an excuse

447
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:55,006
to prevent helicopter use?

448
00:27:57,175 --> 00:27:59,094
I don't know anything about that.

449
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:01,596
That's exactly why this is so serious!

450
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,765
Don't you think you <i>should </i>know about it?

451
00:28:05,725 --> 00:28:08,311
There's no way to prevent such a thing
from happening again,

452
00:28:08,395 --> 00:28:11,272
so I'm considering
accepting Dr. Baek's proposal.

453
00:28:12,982 --> 00:28:14,067
Ah…

454
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:16,236
And I guess you're not curious, then.

455
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:17,654
Constructing a heliport

456
00:28:17,737 --> 00:28:20,782
and creating an emergency
medical service helicopter right here.

457
00:28:22,617 --> 00:28:24,035
- Jesus.
- What's that?

458
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:28,498
Well, Dr. Baek said he'd see to it
that Captain Lee Hyeon-jong survives.

459
00:28:28,581 --> 00:28:31,334
And he asked that I take the lead on this
after he left.

460
00:28:31,418 --> 00:28:35,588
I also think that it's a necessary step
in revitalizing the trauma center.

461
00:28:35,672 --> 00:28:38,550
- Minister, please. I beg you.
- Yeah, what?! Go ahead.

462
00:28:38,633 --> 00:28:40,176
This is way over the line!

463
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:43,221
You're… attempting to strong-arm me!

464
00:28:43,805 --> 00:28:44,806
That's right!

465
00:28:45,515 --> 00:28:47,767
Well, I'm glad we're finally
on the same page.

466
00:29:02,115 --> 00:29:04,075
Hello.
I'm here from the consulate.

467
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:06,327
- Thanks for coming such a long way.
- It's fine. Let's go.

468
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:08,079
There's been another incident.

469
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:10,498
What? Did something happen to the captain?

470
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:12,208
No. I meant the hospital.

471
00:29:12,292 --> 00:29:14,169
The hospital was attacked last night.

472
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:23,219
<i>One of the rebels</i>
<i>that Captain Lee Hyeon-jong killed</i>

473
00:29:23,303 --> 00:29:25,305
<i>was the younger sibling of</i>
<i>the militia's ringleader.</i>

474
00:29:25,388 --> 00:29:27,140
<i>He's been on a rampage,</i>
<i>trying to get revenge.</i>

475
00:29:28,224 --> 00:29:31,269
<i>The fact that he attacked</i>
<i>a UN military hospital is just…</i>

476
00:29:31,352 --> 00:29:33,104
<i>It's a very serious crime.</i>

477
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:35,607
<i>So we transferred Captain Lee Hyeon-jong</i>
<i>to a facility</i>

478
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:37,984
<i>outside the reach of the rebels' network.</i>

479
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:41,321
<i>South Sudan is quite complicated,</i>
<i>as you know,</i>

480
00:29:41,404 --> 00:29:44,699
<i>and the civil war has</i>
<i>seriously compromised public safety.</i>

481
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:48,286
<i>How is his condition</i>
<i>right now?</i>

482
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:51,748
<i>Well, unfortunately,</i>
<i>the facility is pretty run down, so…</i>

483
00:29:51,831 --> 00:29:52,957
<i>Things seem quite bad.</i>

484
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:54,834
<i>Let's just get there quickly.</i>

485
00:30:08,264 --> 00:30:10,517
This looks way too small
to be a hospital.

486
00:30:12,435 --> 00:30:15,271
Hello, Dr. Baek.
Seo Dong-ju, army surgeon.

487
00:30:15,355 --> 00:30:16,397
The patient?

488
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:17,941
I'll lead the way.

489
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:36,626
Necrotizing fasciitis,

490
00:30:36,709 --> 00:30:39,379
various infections,
and multiple organ failure.

491
00:30:39,462 --> 00:30:42,549
We haven't been able to
remove the bullets causing the infection.

492
00:30:42,632 --> 00:30:45,718
So, even with antibiotics,
seems like he's just getting worse.

493
00:30:45,802 --> 00:30:47,512
He has signs of anemia too.

494
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:51,391
Why is the blood transfusion rate so low?
It's almost at the minimum.

495
00:30:51,474 --> 00:30:54,519
Uh, we don't… have much blood.

496
00:30:56,229 --> 00:30:57,730
And why is that?

497
00:30:58,481 --> 00:31:01,150
When the hospital was attacked,
the supply room caught fire,

498
00:31:01,234 --> 00:31:02,819
and all of the blood was destroyed.

499
00:31:02,902 --> 00:31:05,405
We brought a few units with us,
but it's nowhere near enough.

500
00:31:05,488 --> 00:31:06,990
That's really bad.

501
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:10,285
Oh, and Dr. Baek,

502
00:31:11,452 --> 00:31:12,829
if you look at his abdomen,

503
00:31:12,912 --> 00:31:14,998
the color around his organs
is already changing.

504
00:31:15,081 --> 00:31:17,250
So I think you should start
with this area first.

505
00:31:17,333 --> 00:31:18,877
No, that's long gone.

506
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,337
That will be impossible to fix
without enough blood.

507
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:25,633
Let's start by controlling the infection
in his limbs.

508
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:26,676
Yes, sir.

509
00:31:30,513 --> 00:31:31,598
{\an8}Necrotic change.

510
00:31:31,681 --> 00:31:34,517
{\an8}The necrosis already looks
quite advanced.

511
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:37,020
{\an8}Uh, what do we do, Dr. Baek?

512
00:31:37,103 --> 00:31:38,229
Dr. Baek.

513
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:41,482
I think that, in order to keep him alive,

514
00:31:42,442 --> 00:31:43,818
amputation is our best bet.

515
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:47,196
Amputation? But look at him.
He's already in such a bad state.

516
00:31:48,031 --> 00:31:51,034
Amputation will only make it worse.
Dr. Baek, don't do it.

517
00:31:53,161 --> 00:31:54,579
We have no choice.

518
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:57,540
Prep the instruments, and let's move him.

519
00:31:57,624 --> 00:31:58,499
Yes, Doctor.

520
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:00,418
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

521

<i>as head of the trauma center</i>

528
00:32:23,816 --> 00:32:27,403
<i>at Hankuk National University Hospital</i>

529
00:32:27,487 --> 00:32:29,906
<i>Minister of Health and Welfare,</i>
<i>Kang Myeong-hui,</i>

530

<i>the person who recommended Dr. Baek,</i>

00:32:43,252 --> 00:32:45,713
<i>Can Captain Lee Hyeon-jong be saved?</i>

536
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:01,479
- Look at this! I'm bleeding!
- All right, come on.

537
00:33:01,562 --> 00:33:02,480
- I'm bleeding
- Quickly!

538
00:33:02,563 --> 00:33:04,023
Hey, you piece of shit!

539
00:33:04,107 --> 00:33:08,194
I'm gonna fucking kill you! You hear me?
You're fucking dead! I'm coming for you!

540
00:33:25,878 --> 00:33:28,589
Dr. Han! Please!
You need to do something now!

541
00:33:30,425 --> 00:33:33,678
Baek told me to relay this message to you
if you looked lost.

542
00:33:37,473 --> 00:33:38,683
You've got this.

543
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:45,356
Right.

544
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,775
I'm… I'm Baek Kang-hyuk now.

545
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:51,279
- I am… Baek Kang-hyuk now.
- Yes.

546
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:57,160
I am… Baek Kang-hyuk now!

547
00:33:57,243 --> 00:33:59,996
Hey! Look at this, man.
This fucking hurts like hell. Help!

548
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:02,290
Shut up! I'm gonna save you!

549
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:03,374
- Then help me.
- Agnes.

550
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:04,292
- Help us, then!
- Yes!

551
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:06,753
This patient needs Hartmann solution
and an electrocardiogram.

552
00:34:06,836 --> 00:34:08,713
That one needs
a neurosurgical consultation.

553
00:34:08,796 --> 00:34:12,675
Take him to CT now! Quickly!
Shut it, all of you! Just shut up!

554
00:34:12,759 --> 00:34:15,344
Quiet down! I said quiet! Quiet!

555
00:34:15,428 --> 00:34:17,430
Quiet!

556
00:34:17,513 --> 00:34:19,724
I am Baek Kang-hyuk, understand?

557
00:34:20,266 --> 00:34:22,935
If you shut up, you live.
If you keep talking, you die!

558
00:34:26,856 --> 00:34:27,690
Scalpel.

NECROTIZING FASCIITIS/BULLET REMOVAL

560
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:41,537
Mosquito.

561
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:02,225
Betadine.

562
00:35:08,523 --> 00:35:09,607
Saline.

563
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:19,408
How are his vitals?

564
00:35:19,492 --> 00:35:21,661
Any more bleeding,
he'll be in danger.

565
00:35:21,744 --> 00:35:23,788
We've only just worked on
one arm.

566
00:35:26,249 --> 00:35:28,000
Uh, Dr. Baek.

567
00:35:28,709 --> 00:35:30,628
The necrosis is spreading further.

568
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:38,803
You said you had
two units of blood left?

569
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:40,680
Let's use one now.

570
00:35:42,181 --> 00:35:44,100
Can you please
give me the blood bag?

571
00:35:47,311 --> 00:35:48,271
Dr. Baek.

572
00:35:50,356 --> 00:35:51,524
What are you thinking?

573
00:36:09,917 --> 00:36:13,963
We should observe first.
And let's really think about this.

574
00:36:14,046 --> 00:36:16,132
For how long?

575
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:19,385
Until the patient dies?

576
00:36:24,724 --> 00:36:25,600
Hold him.

577
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:49,248
"Air ambulance"?

578
00:36:49,332 --> 00:36:51,250
It's an official request
from Dr. Baek.

579
00:36:51,334 --> 00:36:54,212
He said it was the only way
to save Captain Lee Hyeon-jong.

580
00:36:54,295 --> 00:36:56,505
- Get me more information.
- Yes, ma'am.

581
00:36:56,589 --> 00:36:57,423
Yeah.

582
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:09,143
TO MINISTER KANG MYEONG-HUI:
PLEASE CONTACT ME. HOW DID IT GO?

583
00:37:10,519 --> 00:37:13,397
What the fuck are they waiting for?
Goddammit.

584
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:16,943
Dr. Baek.

585
00:37:19,695 --> 00:37:21,197
Thank you for your efforts.

586
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:26,160
Seeing you work like that and agonize over
saving the patient was incredibly moving.

587
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:27,536
I don't know about that.

588
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:30,414
You've done more than I have though.

589
00:37:30,498 --> 00:37:32,875
I heard, instead of sleeping,
you were caring for the patient.

590
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:35,711
That's right. It needed to be done.

591
00:37:37,463 --> 00:37:39,382
You have potential.

592
00:37:41,008 --> 00:37:41,968
What?

593
00:37:42,051 --> 00:37:44,971
Pay me a visit once you're discharged.
I'll buy you dinner.

594
00:37:46,222 --> 00:37:48,182
- Uh…
- Dr. Baek!

595
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:51,185
- Dr. Baek. Dr. Baek.
- They responded?

596
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:52,520
What you requested.

597
00:37:52,603 --> 00:37:55,314
The relevant government departments
are gonna have a video conference.

598
00:37:55,398 --> 00:37:57,900
They want a conference?
This is ridiculous.

599
00:37:57,984 --> 00:38:00,987
But don't we have more time
since the surgery was a success?

600
00:38:02,905 --> 00:38:05,574
He could still die at any second,
given his condition.

601
00:38:21,924 --> 00:38:25,261
He's just…
in such a bad state.

602
00:38:27,513 --> 00:38:30,975
We haven't even touched
his abdomen, and we're out of blood.

603
00:38:40,234 --> 00:38:43,029
The situation is serious.
We need to transfer him now.

604
00:38:43,112 --> 00:38:44,947
<i>The Ministry of Defense is testing out</i>

605
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:47,700
<i>if we can load medical equipment</i>
<i>onto a cargo plane.</i>

606
00:38:47,783 --> 00:38:48,659
<i>And so…</i>

607
00:38:49,493 --> 00:38:51,662
<i>- How much longer?</i>
<i>- They're saying around two weeks.</i>

608
00:38:51,746 --> 00:38:52,621
<i>Two weeks.</i>

609
00:38:52,705 --> 00:38:55,166
You can fly his corpse out in two weeks.

610
00:38:55,249 --> 00:38:58,252
<i>Transport the corpse?</i>
<i>What did mean by that?</i>

611
00:38:58,336 --> 00:39:00,171
<i>We are doing everything that we can.</i>

612
00:39:00,254 --> 00:39:02,590
<i>We asked flag carriers</i>
<i>if they can remove seats for space--</i>

613
00:39:02,673 --> 00:39:04,508
And when did I ask you to do that?

614
00:39:04,592 --> 00:39:07,136
Air ambulance.
I need an air ambulance now!

615
00:39:07,219 --> 00:39:09,055
<i>What's an air ambulance?</i>

616
00:39:09,138 --> 00:39:12,641
- <i>It's for transporting patients.</i>
<i>- Oh, there is such a thing?</i>

617
00:39:13,934 --> 00:39:15,186
<i>Excuse me, Doctor.</i>

618
00:39:16,479 --> 00:39:19,565
<i>I don't think the air ambulance</i>
<i>is going to be feasible.</i>

619
00:39:19,648 --> 00:39:22,109
<i>We have some issues with costs right now.</i>

620
00:39:22,651 --> 00:39:25,529
<i>Our maximum budget is 500 million won.</i>

621
00:39:26,405 --> 00:39:29,283
<i>And that would cost at least</i>
<i>700 million won right now, so…</i>

622
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:32,453
Is this… really about money?

623
00:39:33,496 --> 00:39:34,955
This guy is gonna die

624
00:39:35,498 --> 00:39:37,416
if he doesn't get the right treatment.

625
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:46,300
Hello?

626
00:39:47,927 --> 00:39:49,095
Yes, Director.

627
00:39:49,178 --> 00:39:51,263
So let's talk.

628
00:39:51,347 --> 00:39:53,182
Is Captain Lee Hyeon-jong all right?

629
00:39:55,017 --> 00:39:58,229
No. At this point,
we can't guarantee his recovery.

630
00:39:58,729 --> 00:40:00,606
<i>In that case,</i>

631
00:40:00,689 --> 00:40:03,359
we should get ready for
the worst-case scenario.

632
00:40:04,151 --> 00:40:05,528
If he dies,

633
00:40:05,611 --> 00:40:09,073
then we need to be clear about
who was responsible for that outcome.

634
00:40:09,156 --> 00:40:09,990
<i>Right?</i>

635
00:40:11,283 --> 00:40:13,702
<i>I also heard that</i>
<i>you performed surgery earlier.</i>

636
00:40:13,786 --> 00:40:17,248
But did you get a chance
to see Dr. Baek work today?

637
00:40:17,331 --> 00:40:18,958
Was there anything he did
that could've put

638
00:40:19,041 --> 00:40:21,085
<i>the patient in danger</i>
<i>or anything like that?</i>

639
00:40:21,168 --> 00:40:22,628
The left arm was…

640
00:40:26,048 --> 00:40:28,175
He just removed infected tissue.

641
00:40:29,218 --> 00:40:31,345
Without blood,
it's difficult to take further action.

642
00:40:34,223 --> 00:40:36,475
All right. I understand.

643
00:40:37,643 --> 00:40:39,562
Keep a close eye on Dr. Baek
going forward.

644
00:40:39,645 --> 00:40:41,522
Yes, Director Choi. Understood.

645
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:48,863
Dr. Gyeong-won?

646
00:40:50,823 --> 00:40:53,117
Were you just on the phone
with Director Choi?

647
00:40:54,201 --> 00:40:56,871
- Uh… Oh, uh…
- What is this?

648
00:40:56,954 --> 00:41:00,124
Have you been reporting back
to the director this whole time?

649
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:02,042
Uh, just hear me out though.

650
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:03,711
No, never mind that.

651
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:07,089
You'd better tell Dr. Baek yourself
before I do.

652
00:41:10,217 --> 00:41:11,218
Wait. Uh…

653
00:41:11,844 --> 00:41:14,221
Nurse Jang-mi. Hold on a minute. Jang-mi!

654
00:41:14,763 --> 00:41:16,599
Just let me explain myself. Uh…

655
00:41:16,682 --> 00:41:18,350
Forget it.

656
00:41:18,434 --> 00:41:20,728
Nurse Jang-mi.
Nurse Jang-mi. Nurse Jang-mi.

657
00:41:21,228 --> 00:41:22,813
Jesus!

658
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:24,231
Captain Lee Hyeon-jong…

659
00:41:24,815 --> 00:41:27,318
- What is it?
- Quickly, come on, come on. Please!

660
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:31,322
Give me that.

661
00:41:35,451 --> 00:41:36,619
How's it looking?

662
00:41:37,703 --> 00:41:38,913
I'm not sure.

663
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:42,583
- For now, uh, we need more blood now.
- We don't have more blood, Doctor.

664
00:41:43,834 --> 00:41:45,127
- What do we do?
- Right.

665
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:51,050
Dr. Baek, they really need your help!

666
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:57,515
Uh… I'll run over there now
and find out what's happening. Yes.

667
00:41:57,598 --> 00:41:58,766
<i>Stop right there!</i>

668
00:41:58,849 --> 00:42:02,269
<i>Hold on. We need to talk about</i>
<i>what to do if he dies.</i>

669
00:42:02,853 --> 00:42:03,979
Huh?

670
00:42:06,398 --> 00:42:07,399
What happened?

671
00:42:07,483 --> 00:42:11,028
Nurse Jang-mi is
transfusing blood as an emergency measure.

672
00:42:11,987 --> 00:42:12,821
Shit.

673
00:42:18,702 --> 00:42:21,539
His blood pressure
increased a little but still unstable.

674
00:42:30,172 --> 00:42:31,298
He needs to be moved.

675
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:33,884
Wait, Dr. Baek.
You're gonna move him?

676
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:35,886
He won't survive here.

677
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:38,556
But we can't just take him
to another hospital.

678
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:40,474
The militia might attack our vehicle.

679
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:42,476
- Get moving.
- Yes, sir.

680
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:44,478
Dr. Baek.

681
00:42:48,857 --> 00:42:51,860
Dr. Baek. I'm begging you.
Please don't do this.

682
00:42:52,361 --> 00:42:55,197
- Or wait for an escort from the army base.
- There's no time for that.

683
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:57,950
Then I'm going with you.

684
00:42:58,033 --> 00:43:00,160
It's even riskier coming with us.

685
00:43:00,244 --> 00:43:01,287
Dr. Baek.

686
00:43:01,954 --> 00:43:02,788
Dr. Seo.

687
00:43:03,747 --> 00:43:06,542
You've done very well so far.
Leave the rest up to us.

688
00:43:06,625 --> 00:43:07,835
Hold on.

689
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:33,611
How is the patient doing?

690
00:43:37,031 --> 00:43:38,532
He's doing all right for now.

691
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:41,285
Still, our blood supply is
running low, Dr. Baek.

692
00:43:44,413 --> 00:43:46,582
- I'll transfuse another.
- What?

693
00:43:46,665 --> 00:43:47,916
No. You can't do that. Don't!

694
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:48,917
It's all right.

695
00:43:49,501 --> 00:43:51,837
You transfused 500 ml already.

696
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:53,672
It's all right. There's no other way.

697
00:44:42,054 --> 00:44:44,348
Unidentified vehicle approaching.
Be on guard.

698
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:46,141
I'll check it.

699
00:44:49,812 --> 00:44:51,980
Stop the car,
or we will open fire!

700
00:45:03,701 --> 00:45:04,910
Hands in the air!

701
00:45:09,415 --> 00:45:10,416
Don't move!

702
00:45:14,712 --> 00:45:17,005
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Whoa!

703
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:21,593
Identify yourself!

704
00:45:25,723 --> 00:45:27,558
Tell Walter that Malak is here.

705
00:45:28,934 --> 00:45:29,977
Hands on the wheel!

706
00:45:31,979 --> 00:45:33,814
Control. Malak is here.

707
00:45:34,606 --> 00:45:36,567
Control, come in. Malak is here.

708
00:45:41,613 --> 00:45:43,115
Malak has returned.

709
00:45:50,414 --> 00:45:51,832
Oh! Dr. Baek.

710
00:45:51,915 --> 00:45:54,042
- His BP is dropping.
- 50 over 30.

711
00:45:54,126 --> 00:45:55,169
Keep your mouth shut!

712
00:45:55,252 --> 00:45:58,297
- I'll transfuse it directly.
- What? That's way too much though!

713
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:00,799
- You're putting yourself at risk.
- We'll lose the patient.

714
00:46:00,883 --> 00:46:02,217
Shut the fuck up!

715
00:46:02,301 --> 00:46:03,719
- Hey!
- Damn it.

716
00:46:05,262 --> 00:46:07,097
- Dr. Baek.
- Dr. Baek, hurry!

717
00:46:07,181 --> 00:46:09,600
Hey, let us in.

718
00:46:09,683 --> 00:46:10,559
Shut up!

719
00:46:11,435 --> 00:46:13,604
Dr. Baek, it's still dropping.

720
00:46:13,687 --> 00:46:15,355
We're gonna lose the patient!

721
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:16,690
Dr. Baek!

722
00:46:16,774 --> 00:46:19,193
- What do we do?
- I'll transfuse the blood!

723
00:46:19,276 --> 00:46:20,444
Don't move.
