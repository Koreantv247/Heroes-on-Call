THE TRAUMA CODE: HEROES ON CALL

2
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:14,324
TRAUMA CENTER HEROES SHINE AMIDST TRAGEDY

3
00:01:20,997 --> 00:01:22,040
AWESOME! A TRUE DOCTOR!

4
00:01:22,957 --> 00:01:23,875
Oh wow.

5
00:01:23,958 --> 00:01:25,627
SEND HIM TO THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY!

6
00:01:26,419 --> 00:01:28,880
I THINK HE IS KINDA SEXY…

7
00:01:32,383 --> 00:01:35,929
"Way to go, Dr. Baek Kang-hyuk."

8
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:40,600
"Dr. Baek is one handsome man."

9
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:42,310
"Handsome man"?

10
00:01:42,393 --> 00:01:43,478
Why? What? Why?

11
00:01:44,687 --> 00:01:47,315
Are you just…
posting that under articles about you?

12
00:01:47,398 --> 00:01:49,651
What about it? Am I wrong though?

13
00:01:51,486 --> 00:01:53,488
Ugh. It's gross.

14
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,658
You're saying it's gross? You'd better--

15
00:01:56,741 --> 00:01:59,702
Uh, no, no.
Jang-mi said it. I didn't say it.

16
00:02:01,246 --> 00:02:02,497
Yes, that's right.

17
00:02:04,165 --> 00:02:06,626
Come on, Jang-mi.
That's not what I meant.

18
00:02:07,418 --> 00:02:09,546
Dr. Baek, this is all your fault now.

19
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,843
Hey. Do you not understand what I'm doing?

20
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:18,221
Yeah? What?

21
00:02:21,432 --> 00:02:25,186
You tell me what our other colleagues…
think about our department.

22
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:27,689
That we're in the red.
We're a giant nuisance.

23
00:02:27,772 --> 00:02:29,482
Uh, and a big drain on the budget.

24
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:30,984
Exactly.

25
00:02:31,776 --> 00:02:34,362
So what should we do
in these circumstances?

26
00:02:34,445 --> 00:02:36,990
- What's the solution?
- Bring in money, I guess.

27
00:02:37,073 --> 00:02:39,951
That's right.
And how do we get that money?

28
00:02:41,786 --> 00:02:43,371
Look. Right here.

29
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:49,627
{\an8}This is our defense.
First, we get public opinion on our side.

30
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:52,172
{\an8}And if we continue saving lives
like we have been,

31
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:56,467
{\an8}the public will eventually understand
how essential we are.

32
00:02:56,968 --> 00:03:00,096
{\an8}At that point,
the hospital will have to respect us.

33
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,472
Uh, okay.

34
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:05,476
So I'm like the… god
of the trauma center now.

35
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:08,396
And you… you're the son.

36
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,065
She's the holy ghost.

37
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:16,404
Ah. She's a big liability though.

38
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:19,365
Uh, sorry about that.

39
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:38,009
Ah!

40
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:42,138
Gosh. I'm just in a bit of a rush,
so… I wanted to speed things up.

41
00:03:43,431 --> 00:03:44,807
Congratulations.

42
00:03:45,808 --> 00:03:47,101
You got what you wanted.

43
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:52,148
Oh, I think the congratulations can wait
until later when we're… fully staffed.

44
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:53,816
Fully staffed? Are you serious?

45
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:57,528
Ah. I think she might… have time
to take a call.

46
00:03:57,612 --> 00:03:59,239
Are you threatening me right now?

47
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:00,573
Yes.

48
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:03,910
That's exactly… what I'm doing.

49
00:04:05,828 --> 00:04:08,039
MINISTER KANG MYEONG-HUI

50
00:04:09,165 --> 00:04:11,084
The public seems to be turning
their attention

51
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:14,712
to the trauma center right now
because of the Sowol Bridge accident,

52
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:15,880
isn't that right?

53
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:20,218
Don't you think that now is the best time
to give them our full support?

54
00:04:20,301 --> 00:04:22,053
- This way, Minister.
- Mm.

55
00:04:22,553 --> 00:04:24,806
So you agree with me too,
right, Director Choi?

56
00:04:25,306 --> 00:04:27,809
<i>With the peace agreement signed</i>
<i>last August,</i>

57
00:04:27,892 --> 00:04:29,894
{\an8}<i>Doctors for International Peace</i>
<i>has announced</i>

58
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:32,063
{\an8}<i>the resumption of</i>
<i>volunteer medical activities…</i>

59
00:04:32,146 --> 00:04:35,191
Put out that recruitment notice
for trauma center staff.

60
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:36,693
Huh? But, Director--

61
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:39,237
The minister says
she has put all her faith in us.

62
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,197
She requested our full support on this.

63
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:43,032
Don't worry about it.

64
00:04:43,574 --> 00:04:46,661
Postings like this always have
zero applicants anyway.

65
00:04:46,744 --> 00:04:49,747
This deficit's already driving me insane
as it is, and now, this?

66
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,250
You know how many
helicopter calls there were?

67
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:54,085
Last week, there were five of them!

68
00:04:54,168 --> 00:04:55,503
That's very expensive!

69
00:04:55,586 --> 00:04:58,089
It's like he's out to get me or something!

70
00:04:58,172 --> 00:05:00,008
Ah, I know what you mean.

71
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:08,850
You know this is about you as well.

72
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:11,269
Sir? Yes. Yes, yes, yes, I know.

73
00:05:11,352 --> 00:05:14,689
All right…
'cause you should be very concerned

74
00:05:15,606 --> 00:05:17,025
with this situation as well.

75
00:05:17,608 --> 00:05:19,986
We can't let Baek Kang-hyuk
get away with this.

76
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:20,903
Right.

77
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:22,447
Don't tell me…

78
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:25,450
Are you waiting for them
to appoint you as director?

79
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:27,535
Is that what's going on here?

80
00:05:27,618 --> 00:05:29,954
Oh, uh, Director Choi,
don't be ridiculous.

81
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:31,164
Of course not!

82
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:33,583
It's not your role as
future hospital director.

83
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:36,753
It's your current role as head of planning
and coordination that's at risk.

84
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:40,548
We'll have no choice except
to let go of our highest-paid positions.

85
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:42,592
Someone like you, Director Hong.

86
00:05:44,552 --> 00:05:46,596
Yes, sir. I'm very well aware.

87
00:05:47,263 --> 00:05:48,931
Oh, you're "aware," are you?

88
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:52,143
You need to start taking action. Action!

89
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:01,152
Always ordering me around.
I'm practically his slave.

90
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:04,030
Why? What gives him the right?

91
00:06:04,113 --> 00:06:05,948
Wait, what happened?

92
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:10,161
Director Choi is throwing a fit
because of Dr. Baek.

93
00:06:10,244 --> 00:06:11,287
Oh, right.

94
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:15,083
The minister forced him to sign off
on that trauma surgery budget increase,

95
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:16,667
so he's totally lost his mind.

96
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:18,461
Is that right? He signed off?

97
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:20,213
My reaction exactly. Yeah, it's decided.

98
00:06:20,296 --> 00:06:22,590
Ah. That's a relief.

99
00:06:22,673 --> 00:06:25,468
I was gonna bring that up
with you anyway.

100
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:26,886
"Relief"?

101
00:06:29,263 --> 00:06:30,890
Ah, well, you know how it is.

102
00:06:30,973 --> 00:06:35,353
It's just inevitable that trauma surgery
will incur large deficits like this, so…

103
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:37,313
And why would that concern you?

104
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:40,650
Oh, well, just, you know,
as head of general surgery--

105
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:41,651
Exactly.

106
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:44,862
Pretty soon, we'll all be out of work,
and you're telling me it's a relief?

107
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:45,905
How can you say that?

108
00:06:48,032 --> 00:06:51,619
You're not changing your tune
because he saved Ji-yeong's life, are you?

109
00:06:51,702 --> 00:06:53,496
What?

110
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:56,833
Oh, come on. Like I'm gonna go over
to his side and betray you?

111
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:59,085
I'm disappointed
you'd even think that. Huh?

112
00:06:59,168 --> 00:07:00,461
We've known each other so long!

113
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:04,966
We've been through ups and downs together.
For 20 years, we've been like brothers!

114
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:11,514
How can he be so weak-willed like that?
It's ridiculous.

115
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:18,521
Damn helicopter is always
in the air lately.

116
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,815
Why, you little…

117
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:24,193
Hey!

118
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:27,363
Quit that racket, would you?
You're a nuisance!

119
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:31,451
Hey, listen here, you assholes!

120
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:41,127
Baek Kang-hyuk's wings?

121
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:45,715
I'll clip them to pieces.

122
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:51,804
Uh, Dr. Baek, where should we go?

123
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:53,055
Emergency OR!

124
00:07:54,932 --> 00:07:55,766
Here.

125
00:07:57,393 --> 00:08:00,021
- Take good care of them!
- Will do. Thank you!

126
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:07,028
- Huh?
- I'll phone the next of kin.

127
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:09,739
Go register the patient's
personal information.

128
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:13,242
- Doesn't the medical team do that?
- Let's help each other out a little.

129
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:16,496
We get to work in shifts.
They don't even have time to rest. Go.

130
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:21,292
Could I make a quick phone call?

131
00:08:24,253 --> 00:08:25,171
Number One.

132
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:27,465
- Prep for a thoracotomy.
- Yes, sir.

133
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:29,467
Intubating now.

134
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:31,052
- Dr. Park?
- Yes?

135
00:08:31,135 --> 00:08:34,805
His BP's low. Administer
muscle relaxants as slowly as possible.

136
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:36,015
"Dr. Park"?

137
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:39,852
Why don't I
get called Dr. Yang, huh?

138
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:42,104
Shut up
and get on with disinfecting.

139
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:45,942
Yes, Doctor.

140
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:49,070
Breathing tube's in.
I'll start on the anesthetic.

141
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:54,492
- Hand towels.
- Oh. Right.

142
00:08:56,452 --> 00:08:57,703
You unfolded…

143
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:06,462
Gown.

144
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:08,548
Uh, uh… Oh, right, yes.

145
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:10,091
Here.

146
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:15,513
Seriously. What the hell?

147
00:09:15,596 --> 00:09:17,557
Ah. My name is Agnes, Doctor.

148
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,267
I wasn't asking for your name.

149
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:20,935
She's new here, Dr. Baek.

150
00:09:21,018 --> 00:09:24,522
She's also Catholic,
which is why her name is Agnes.

151
00:09:24,605 --> 00:09:27,942
She's come over from emergency medicine,
so go easy on her.

152
00:09:28,025 --> 00:09:30,486
- I asked for reinforcements.
- Ah.

153
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:33,447
And they send some rookie?

154
00:09:34,031 --> 00:09:35,491
Whoa.

155
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:40,621
Oh. No, no, no, no. It's all right.
Don't touch it. Just leave it.

156
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:43,624
I want you to just sit still
right over here, okay?

157
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:45,084
Daddy will take care of it.

158
00:09:49,797 --> 00:09:52,008
Jesus, those things are loud.

159
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,140
Oh, Jae-hun… Uh…

160
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:09,150
Hello, Fire Commissioner.
Yes, it's me.

161
00:10:09,233 --> 00:10:10,443
- Huh?
- Dad?

162
00:10:10,526 --> 00:10:12,194
What is he doing over there?

163
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:15,656
{\an8}How kind of you, Jae-hun,
to come visit this old man in person.

164
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:16,741
Oh, of course!

165
00:10:17,491 --> 00:10:18,701
I wanted to see you.

166
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:22,663
Also, I've brought your doctor up to speed

167
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:26,751
so you can stay focused on your treatment
during your stay with us.

168
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:32,882
<i>The commissioner of</i>
<i>the National Fire Agency?</i>

169
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:34,842
<i>Why is Jae-hun visiting him?</i>

170
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:40,139
<i>I have a bad feeling about this.</i>
<i>Hmm. A really bad feeling.</i>

00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:45,728
What?

175
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,691
- I think you should take a look at this.
- Why is something wrong?

176
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:55,571
{\an8}PERSONNEL TRANSFERS
AN JUNG-HEON TO ADMINISTRATION

177
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:03,829
Pediatrics agreed to give us an
official reply about this patient, right?

178
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:05,665
They promised to email within the day.

179
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:07,708
The prognosis isn't serious…

180
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:09,251
Doc… Dr. Baek.

181
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:13,631
A… A patient suffered a fall at Bukhansan.
It's a serious head injury.

182
00:11:13,714 --> 00:11:15,091
- Get ready to move, Gangster.
- Okay.

183
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:17,009
Wait! They won't let us go.

184
00:11:17,718 --> 00:11:18,969
What the hell are you saying?

185
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:21,347
I mean, I contacted
the National Rescue Unit

186
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:23,349
immediately after I received the call,

187
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:25,476
and it sounds like Mr. An

188
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:27,937
was transferred out.

189
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:39,031
This is the National Rescue Unit speaking.

190
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:41,742
<i>This is Baek Kang-hyuk of</i>
<i>Hankuk National University Hospital.</i>

191
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:42,660
Uh…

192
00:11:42,743 --> 00:11:45,621
What's this about not being able
to deploy the helicopter?

193
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:47,832
<i>Dr. Baek, it's just… Let me explain.</i>

194
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:50,501
We're running out of time.
We need to get there right away.

195
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:54,880
Just a moment.

196
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:55,965
"Just a moment"?

197
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,426
We need every second we can get right now.

198
00:11:58,509 --> 00:11:59,677
- Let's go!
- <i>Hello?</i>

199
00:12:00,469 --> 00:12:01,721
<i>Dr. Baek Kang-hyuk?</i>

200
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:03,305
Yes. Who is this?

201
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:04,807
{\an8}I'm the new team leader.

202
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:06,475
{\an8}119 AIR RESCUE UNIT
CHO DEOK-GYU

203
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:09,937
{\an8}I'd heard a lot about you, Dr. Baek,
so I took a look through our records.

204
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:13,149
<i>Seems you've been ordering the helicopter</i>
<i>over the phone like you own it.</i>

205
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:16,152
<i>This is state property.</i>
<i>You can't just use it at your convenience.</i>

206
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:17,945
- "At my convenience"? What?
- What is it?

207
00:12:18,028 --> 00:12:20,865
It even says that
you piloted at one point.

208
00:12:20,948 --> 00:12:22,658
Do you have a helicopter license?

209
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:24,452
<i>Is that really what's important here?</i>

210
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:27,371
Yes, I flew the damn thing,
and nobody got hurt. Understand?

211
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:29,206
Just send the helicopter right away.

212
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:31,000
<i>Please don't raise your voice.</i>
<i>Going forward,</i>

213
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:33,419
<i>we will no longer accept requests</i>
<i>for services via telephone.</i>

214
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:35,588
Fill out an official request,

215
00:12:35,671 --> 00:12:37,715
and follow the proper procedures
from now on.

216
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:39,925
You must be joking--

217
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:41,594
Are you there? Hey!

218
00:12:41,677 --> 00:12:42,970
- Dr. Baek--
- That little--

219
00:12:43,053 --> 00:12:45,806
- Dr. Baek. Dr… Dr… Dr. Baek!
- You asshole!

220
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:47,516
Please don't curse! No cursing.

221
00:12:48,392 --> 00:12:49,351
Calm down.

222
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:50,770
Just breathe.

223
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:52,855
Breathe.

224
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:54,106
Damn it!

225
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:58,611
What's wrong now? What is it?
Aren't they sending a helicopter?

226
00:12:58,694 --> 00:13:01,530
Uh-uh. They won't budge
no matter what we say.

227
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:03,157
Ugh. Forget it.

228
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:07,787
Our priority is Bukhansan.
Get in touch with the first responders.

229
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:10,164
Hello?

230
00:13:10,247 --> 00:13:12,291
<i>It's Yang Jae-won from</i>
<i>Hankuk University Hospital.</i>

231
00:13:12,374 --> 00:13:13,876
<i>What's the status of the patient?</i>

232
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:16,170
His blood pressure is 80 over 50.

233
00:13:16,253 --> 00:13:18,964
Unconscious, and his left eye
is showing slow pupil response.

234
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:20,299
Are you on your way?

235
00:13:20,382 --> 00:13:22,092
Ah, well, unfortunately,

236
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:23,761
we can't get there right away.

237
00:13:23,844 --> 00:13:25,221
The National Rescue Unit said

238
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:28,015
they need an official request
to send the helicopter over here, so…

239
00:13:28,098 --> 00:13:29,683
<i>An official request?</i>

240
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:31,727
Those only get approved in the morning.

241
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:35,147
They know this is an emergency, right?

242
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:37,107
<i>Yes, we've tried to reason with them.</i>

243
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:42,238
Do you think there's a way for us
to get there with just a vehicle?

244
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:43,322
<i>Uh, yes, it's possible.</i>

245
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:45,783
<i>We'll get the patient</i>
<i>to the entrance of the hiking trail.</i>

246
00:13:45,866 --> 00:13:47,576
<i>Please come as quickly as you can.</i>

247
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,161
All right. That sounds good.

248
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:52,331
Wait, what the hell?

249
00:13:52,414 --> 00:13:55,042
Great. And how are we supposed
to get there? We gonna take a taxi?

250
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:57,586
You may as well tell them
to hail a cab right now!

251
00:13:58,087 --> 00:14:00,422
Well, we… we have an ambulance though.

252
00:14:01,131 --> 00:14:02,800
- An ambulance?
- Yes.

253
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:11,392
We don't have time for this.
What are you doing?

254
00:14:11,475 --> 00:14:13,519
- Take a look!
- Huh? What is this?

255
00:14:13,602 --> 00:14:15,980
With the helicopter,
we haven't had to use it.

256
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:19,275
The trauma center funding was used
to purchase a high-end ambulance.

257
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:21,110
The higher-ups wanted something
to brag about.

258
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:24,488
Wow. This has all we need.
Hey, why haven't we ever used this? Huh?

259
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:25,865
Let's get going right away.

260
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:28,033
Yes, sir.
I'll get in the back, Dr. Baek.

261
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:31,829
You getting in?

262
00:14:31,912 --> 00:14:33,706
Shouldn't I be here instead?

263
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:36,250
No. We need you for the head count.

264
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:38,460
- What head count?
- Gangster, come on! I'm not arguing!

265
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:39,879
Oh.

266
00:15:07,531 --> 00:15:11,201
Ah! Slow down, Dr. Baek!
Could you please drive more carefully?

267
00:15:12,494 --> 00:15:15,539
Oh, why'd you bring me with you?
Was it so you could kill me?

268
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:28,260
Ah, watch out, Dr. Baek!

269
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,981
BUKHANSAN NATIONAL PARK

270
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:42,691
Number One,
we're almost there.

271
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:44,109
Ask for an exact location.

272
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:47,237
We're almost there.
Where exactly are you?

273
00:15:49,573 --> 00:15:52,284
- Hey, Dr. Baek! Turn right at the fork.
- Okay.

274
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:22,940
It's been a while. I'm a little rusty.
The speed on this thing--

275
00:16:23,023 --> 00:16:25,651
That was like a runaway train
with no brakes. You're a crazy driver.

276
00:16:25,734 --> 00:16:27,736
Uh, quiet. The patient's here.

277
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,446
Hey, come on. Quickly, quickly!

278
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:41,041
We're low on time.
Let's talk on the way.

279
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:42,001
Okay.

280
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:50,467
I'll move our car for you.

281
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:01,270
Ah. Yeah, I still got it from
my days as a valet.

282
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:09,945
There was no pupil response in
the left eye? When did you last check it?

283
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:12,322
We checked
when we first found him. Not since then.

284
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:15,117
Dr. Baek,
there's no urination or defecation.

285
00:17:15,659 --> 00:17:18,078
- Let's start. Shave his head first.
- Yes, Doctor.

286
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,839
No response on his right either.

287
00:17:28,922 --> 00:17:30,507
Does that mean it's serious?

288
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,470
{\an8}If the brain itself is damaged,
there's nothing we can do.

289
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:37,556
{\an8}But hopefully, it's a temporary effect
of a brain hemorrhage.

290
00:17:39,641 --> 00:17:41,477
If only we'd gotten here sooner.

291
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,312
Shave and disinfect his head.

292
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:45,314
We need to make the incision now.

293
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:47,316
Uh, hold on a minute. Incision?

294
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:49,151
In a moving vehicle?

295
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:51,320
Yes. We need to do it right away.

296
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:02,081
<i>Nurse Jang-mi,</i>
<i>are you on your way?</i>

297
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:05,459
Get the team in neurology ready
to see him as soon as we arrive.

298
00:18:09,838 --> 00:18:12,049
There is no free space
in his skull at all.

299
00:18:13,675 --> 00:18:15,260
Intracranial pressure is high.

300
00:18:16,303 --> 00:18:18,555
It's not good.
We can't even see the bleed.

301
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:20,933
Doctor, is that really bad?

302
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:25,145
If a bleed is the cause, we can remove it.

303
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:28,649
But when the brain is swollen
in general, then…

304
00:18:28,732 --> 00:18:29,858
Give him steroids.

305
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:31,693
Let's make another hole.

306
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:34,446
What? Uh, another one?

307
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:38,534
What are you waiting for?

308
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:46,250
What's the point of any of this?

309
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:51,130
Blood pressure's falling.

310
00:19:00,597 --> 00:19:03,350
His pulse is okay. Start disinfecting.

311
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:05,769
The brain stem is herniating.

312
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:07,980
Still, we need to do whatever we can.

313
00:19:09,898 --> 00:19:10,732
Hurry up.

314
00:19:13,026 --> 00:19:13,861
Number One.

315
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:18,532
What's the point of even trying anymore?
Nobody else gives a shit.

316
00:19:18,615 --> 00:19:20,826
So what? You saying we should give up?

317
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:25,747
All the hospital does is nag us about
the budget deficit or whatever.

318
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:29,418
They won't even let us fly
the helicopter without a request!

319
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:31,336
So what's the point of any of it?

320
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:34,131
Don't get hung up on the helicopter.
This is in our hands now.

321
00:19:34,214 --> 00:19:36,258
You're right. It's completely up to us.

322
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:38,760
If they had flown us out here
like we asked,

323
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:40,387
this patient would've had a chance.

324
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:41,555
Stop all of this now!

325
00:19:42,806 --> 00:19:46,268
Every second you waste talking,
the patient inches closer to death.

326
00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:51,440
Hold him. We're making… a second hole.

327
00:20:07,956 --> 00:20:08,916
Dr. Baek.

328
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:12,002
We requested a neurology consult.
They're waiting for you inside.

329
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:22,429
- I'm No Jun-yong of neurology.
- Wasn't expecting the head of neurology.

330
00:20:22,512 --> 00:20:24,640
Yes, I've been waiting
to be of assistance to you.

331
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:26,391
Oh, I see. Thank you.

332
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:28,393
- Prepare for CT.
- Yes, Dr. No.

333
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:37,152
Hey there.

334
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:40,572
- Yes?
- Did… something happen on the way here?

335
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:43,700
I… I thought I heard arguing in there.

336
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:49,039
His brain function
is significantly decreased overall.

337
00:20:49,998 --> 00:20:52,376
Sensory function doesn't seem too bad.

338
00:20:53,293 --> 00:20:55,337
{\an8}But the issue is
motor function.

339
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:56,421
{\an8}Yes.

340
00:20:57,839 --> 00:21:00,509
If he survives,
he'll probably need lifelong care.

341
00:21:01,176 --> 00:21:03,428
Thankfully, you were there
to treat him on-site.

342
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:05,347
He's still alive for now.

343
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:09,142
We're still in the acute phase.

344
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:11,770
We'll run some more tests
and let you know.

345
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:16,149
No need to request consults.
We'll be sure to monitor his progress.

346
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:19,069
Take good care of him, please.

347
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:24,700
Uh, Dr. Baek.

348
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:27,119
His next of kin is here.

349
00:21:35,877 --> 00:21:37,671
As of now,

350
00:21:38,755 --> 00:21:41,591
the patient is in a vegetative state.

351
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:45,762
There's nothing else you can do?

352
00:21:46,888 --> 00:21:48,307
I'm so sorry.

353
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:52,144
Oh my gosh!

354
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:04,448
<i>If they had transported him via</i>
<i>helicopter, maybe he'd be all right now.</i>

355
00:22:04,531 --> 00:22:06,199
<i>Dr. Baek seems devastated.</i>

356
00:22:08,243 --> 00:22:10,662
<i>Not only did he perform a tracheotomy</i>
<i>in a moving vehicle,</i>

357
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:12,664
<i>he even bore two holes into the skull.</i>

358
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:16,877
<i>He did everything he could to save him.</i>

359
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:20,589
He pulled out all the stops
to keep the patient alive.

360
00:22:31,099 --> 00:22:32,851
They couldn't use a helicopter?

361
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:43,028
This smells fishy, huh.

362
00:22:43,111 --> 00:22:47,032
Jae-hun was definitely laughing with
the fire commissioner in his room earlier.

363
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:50,660
I'm 100% sure. Huh. Should I tell him?

364
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:52,662
Or should I not?

365
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:57,042
I can't become friends with Dr. Baek.

366
00:22:59,669 --> 00:23:01,922
Ah, forget it.
I don't have tell him anything.

367
00:23:13,016 --> 00:23:13,850
Hello?

368
00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:16,144
<i>Please listen carefully</i>
<i>to what I'm saying.</i>

369
00:23:17,771 --> 00:23:19,898
I heard the helicopter was grounded today,

370
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,943
which means, in the future,
you'll have fewer patients.

371
00:23:23,026 --> 00:23:25,404
If you have fewer patients,
the budget deficit will go down.

372
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:30,033
<i>- You understand what I'm saying?</i>
- Dr. Han Yu-rim, what are you saying?

373
00:23:32,327 --> 00:23:34,996
How'd he know it was me? Is he nearby?

374
00:23:41,044 --> 00:23:42,629
<i>Anyways, Dr. Baek,</i>

375
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:45,924
<i>you can't tell anyone</i>
<i>that you heard this from me.</i>

376
00:23:46,967 --> 00:23:49,428
<i>But with regards to the helicopter</i>
<i>being grounded,</i>

377
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:52,013
<i>I have a strong suspicion</i>
<i>that it might have</i>

378
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:54,474
<i>a little something</i>
<i>to do with Director Hong.</i>

379
00:23:56,309 --> 00:23:57,185
Dr. Jung,

380
00:23:57,269 --> 00:24:00,355
I've been told the route that you take
to work is quite "circulatory."

381
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:02,649
Sometimes I take the freeway.

382
00:24:04,985 --> 00:24:05,861
Baek Kang-hyuk?

383
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:09,823
What on earth do you think you're doing?

384
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:15,078
I could ask you the same thing as well.

385
00:24:15,162 --> 00:24:16,705
What on earth are you doing?

386
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:20,208
I don't follow your question.

387
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:21,418
The helicopter.

388
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,629
Yeah? What about the helicopter?

389
00:24:26,506 --> 00:24:28,967
You did it. You grounded the helicopter.

390
00:24:29,968 --> 00:24:31,219
Excuse me?

391
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:32,179
Dr. Baek, uh--

392
00:24:32,262 --> 00:24:34,890
Do you know that a patient almost died?

393
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:41,188
So what if I did?
Do you have any evidence that I did? Huh?

394
00:24:41,771 --> 00:24:43,857
You know you can't just
barge in like this.

395
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:46,401
Sounds like you're saying
a patient was in danger

396
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:48,236
because the helicopter was grounded.

397
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:51,573
Still, you can't just go around
accusing people without evidence.

398
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:54,242
Are you fucking joking?

399
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:56,828
Excuse me? How dare you!

400
00:24:56,912 --> 00:25:00,457
I tell you that a patient almost died,
and this is your answer?

401
00:25:01,541 --> 00:25:03,835
Oh my God. You really are a piece of shit.

402
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:06,254
- You're out of line! Take it easy.
- Why, you little prick!

403
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:07,172
What?

404
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:10,550
You don't like cursing, but you don't care
whether a patient lives or dies?

405
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:12,219
I will destroy you, you son of a bitch!

406
00:25:12,302 --> 00:25:13,136
- Hey!
- Huh?

407
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:14,596
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

408
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:16,139
Ah, my back!

409
00:25:18,475 --> 00:25:19,935
Don't move. Just lie there.

410
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:21,728
For your own sake.

411
00:25:23,605 --> 00:25:25,273
Uh…

412
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:27,400
Director Hong.

413
00:25:27,901 --> 00:25:29,319
Are you okay? Sir, are you--

414
00:25:29,402 --> 00:25:30,278
Get off!

415
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:37,244
HANKUK NATIONAL UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

416
00:25:37,327 --> 00:25:39,162
You must be crazy, you know that?

417
00:25:39,246 --> 00:25:41,289
I mean, why do such a thing?

418
00:25:42,707 --> 00:25:44,960
Right, I must have gone insane.

419
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:48,338
But why challenge Dr. Baek?
You know how he is.

420
00:25:48,421 --> 00:25:49,923
Ah…

421
00:25:50,006 --> 00:25:51,800
Honestly, why did I do it?

422
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:53,385
Seriously.

423
00:25:53,885 --> 00:25:54,886
Ugh.

424
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:56,763
Uh, why…

425
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:01,351
Nurse Jang-mi. Hello, speaking.

426
00:26:01,851 --> 00:26:03,019
<i>- Dr. Jae-won.</i>
- Hmm?

427
00:26:03,103 --> 00:26:05,814
<i>Where are you right now?</i>
<i>Dr. Baek is looking for you.</i>

428
00:26:06,648 --> 00:26:07,857
Dr. Baek is?

429
00:26:07,941 --> 00:26:11,444
<i>Yes. He wants you to come to the roof</i>
<i>of the old building right away.</i>

430
00:26:11,528 --> 00:26:13,989
<i>- You know where that is, right?</i>
- He's on the roof?

431
00:26:15,699 --> 00:26:19,244
I think it has to be really creepy
and dark up there at this hour.

432
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:20,829
<i>Come quickly.</i>

433
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:45,020
Ah! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

434
00:26:45,103 --> 00:26:46,187
What's that?

435
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:47,522
Thought it was a person.

436
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:51,359
- Oh! Dr. Jae-won.
- Oh, what?

437
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:52,902
Nurse Jang-mi.

438
00:26:54,988 --> 00:26:56,740
Wait, what are you doing here?

439
00:26:57,824 --> 00:27:00,118
Actually, I wanted to see you.

440
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:02,245
You wanted to see me?

441
00:27:03,413 --> 00:27:04,956
Okay. Why?

442
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:08,835
The paramedic told me
that you had a really hard time today.

443
00:27:08,918 --> 00:27:11,379
Ah… You heard that.

444
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:16,343
I come here… every time
there's something that pisses me off.

445
00:27:17,177 --> 00:27:20,013
Every five minutes,
this air vent here switches on.

446
00:27:20,096 --> 00:27:21,931
When it does, I come over and… Oh.

447
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:27,062
Listen here, you motherfucking assholes!

448
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:29,981
- You're all sons of bitches!
- Wait! Wait! What wrong? What is this?

449
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:31,024
What's wrong?

450
00:27:31,107 --> 00:27:32,901
- You call yourselves human?
- Stop it, Jang-mi!

451
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:34,152
No!

452
00:27:34,235 --> 00:27:37,822
Someone was dying,
and you fuckers ground the helicopter!

453
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:39,532
I'm gonna kill you all!

454
00:27:39,616 --> 00:27:41,368
I'm going to kill
every fucking one of you!

455
00:27:41,451 --> 00:27:44,329
Jesus, that girl is always screaming
into a vent up there.

456
00:27:44,412 --> 00:27:45,664
And why this vent?

457
00:27:45,747 --> 00:27:47,332
Oh, stop. Leave her alone.

458
00:27:47,415 --> 00:27:49,167
- She's a good kid.
- Motherfucking assholes!

459
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:50,669
Hey! Stop it. Stop that now!

460
00:27:50,752 --> 00:27:52,671
You're gonna pay for this!

461
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:59,803
Wow. Uh, wow.

462
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:02,639
I always feel good after I yell like that.

463
00:28:05,308 --> 00:28:07,143
- You should try it too. Hmm.
- Huh?

464
00:28:08,311 --> 00:28:10,146
No, it's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

465
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:12,023
Oh, please, please, please.

466
00:28:12,107 --> 00:28:13,983
- Do it.
- Oh, it's… it's just that…

467
00:28:15,985 --> 00:28:17,487
I've never really cursed.

468
00:28:21,574 --> 00:28:23,785
Oh, don't worry. Just say whatever, then.

469
00:28:24,619 --> 00:28:26,287
- Uh…
- Whatever you wanna say.

470
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:29,040
- Okay.
- Mm.

471
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:34,129
Hey, assholes!

472
00:28:34,212 --> 00:28:36,089
Uh, uh, you're, uh…

473
00:28:36,589 --> 00:28:38,591
Huh?

474
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:51,187
{\an8}Uh… It's over.

475
00:28:51,271 --> 00:28:53,356
{\an8}Try again later.
It'll switch on again in five minutes.

476
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,816
{\an8}I'm sorry.

477
00:28:56,526 --> 00:28:57,819
{\an8}- That was hilarious.
- Oh, this is…

478
00:28:59,154 --> 00:29:00,238
Ugh, sorry.

479
00:29:00,864 --> 00:29:02,991
I guess I'm not good at comforting people.

480
00:29:03,074 --> 00:29:04,743
Oh, not at all. That's all right.

481
00:29:04,826 --> 00:29:08,788
Well, I guess it did… do
something good, I suppose. Yes.

482
00:29:10,665 --> 00:29:11,666
Seriously?

483
00:29:13,168 --> 00:29:14,252
That's a relief.

484
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:17,964
Ugh, I was honestly so nervous
that you'd actually leave us.

485
00:29:21,384 --> 00:29:22,802
I wouldn't leave.

486
00:29:25,555 --> 00:29:28,433
But I'm mad at Dr. Baek. That is true.

487
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:33,772
Honestly… I just can't figure it out,
you know?

488
00:29:33,855 --> 00:29:35,482
How to keep pushing forward.

489
00:29:35,565 --> 00:29:36,483
Hmm.

490
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,945
You know, I think I get it.

491
00:29:41,029 --> 00:29:41,946
Really?

492
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:44,699
Yeah, I think so.

493
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:47,076
You certainly have the ability.

494
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:54,125
Looking at you,

495
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:57,587
it's like looking at my old self.

496
00:29:58,588 --> 00:29:59,923
I used to think,

497
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:04,594
"Why endure all this bullshit
when no one ever acknowledges it?"

498
00:30:04,677 --> 00:30:06,346
I asked myself that all the time.

499
00:30:08,556 --> 00:30:11,059
Acknowledgment's not really
why we do this, is it?

500
00:30:12,727 --> 00:30:14,395
Money's not the reason either.

501
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:16,898
Right.

502
00:30:17,398 --> 00:30:18,608
Look at me though.

503
00:30:19,442 --> 00:30:23,655
Do you think I'm a fifth-year senior nurse
because I'm some kind of superhero?

504
00:30:24,739 --> 00:30:25,615
Mm-mm.

505
00:30:27,617 --> 00:30:30,745
No, it's because I have to.
I mean, someone has to do it.

506
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:32,247
That happens to be me.

507
00:30:32,747 --> 00:30:35,375
Unfortunately, it happens to be you too.

508
00:30:35,458 --> 00:30:36,918
That's just how it works out.

509
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:37,877
Hmm?

510
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:40,463
Let's agree

511
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:42,882
to keep going.

512
00:30:46,386 --> 00:30:47,220
Bam.

513
00:30:49,138 --> 00:30:50,306
Thanks for this.

514
00:30:57,355 --> 00:31:00,316
DR. BAEK KANG-HYUK: TO THE CAFETERIA

00:31:08,783 --> 00:31:11,369
Why is he summoning me
out of the blue at this hour?

517
00:31:12,287 --> 00:31:14,122
Does he know I'm the rat?

518
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:16,291
He knows.

519
00:31:23,339 --> 00:31:24,549
You asked to see me?

520
00:31:25,633 --> 00:31:27,385
Yes. Sit down.

521
00:31:28,428 --> 00:31:31,014
You're working quite late tonight, huh?

522
00:31:31,097 --> 00:31:33,975
You're working too hard, yeah?
You should conserve your energy.

523
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:37,103
Yu-rim.

524
00:31:37,186 --> 00:31:40,231
Yes? Your humble servant,
Yu-rim, is all ears.

525
00:31:41,524 --> 00:31:42,442
I…

526
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:47,947
must destroy Baek Kang-hyuk.

527
00:31:50,325 --> 00:31:51,159
What?

528
00:31:54,829 --> 00:31:56,915
You have dirt on him, don't you?

529
00:32:16,976 --> 00:32:17,810
Um…

530
00:32:18,353 --> 00:32:19,646
Sir.

531
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:23,733
Have some food.

532
00:32:24,651 --> 00:32:25,485
Sure.

533
00:32:36,829 --> 00:32:40,166
I was out of line earlier,
and I let you down.

534
00:32:40,249 --> 00:32:41,167
I…

535
00:32:42,585 --> 00:32:44,128
No, I understand.

536
00:32:45,588 --> 00:32:46,422
Sir?

537
00:32:47,173 --> 00:32:49,258
No one else seems to care about our team

538
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:52,220
or the work we do, so why do it?

539
00:32:53,429 --> 00:32:56,516
That's something…
I've thought about as well.

540
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:04,857
Did I ever tell you…

541
00:33:06,859 --> 00:33:10,279
my father… passed away
in a traffic accident.

542
00:33:11,322 --> 00:33:12,907
You mentioned it before, yes.

543
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:17,036
That day,

544
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:20,331
he was on the brink of death
after the accident.

545
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:23,501
Not a single hospital would take him in.

546
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:24,961
Pathetic.

547
00:33:28,297 --> 00:33:29,257
The real issue

548
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:33,594
is that deaths like that keep happening
every single day.

549
00:33:35,263 --> 00:33:36,347
It's a tragedy.

550
00:33:37,598 --> 00:33:38,683
They're abandoned

551
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:41,436
and end up dead.

552
00:33:41,978 --> 00:33:42,895
So, I…

553
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:47,817
I promised myself that I would
never ever give up on a patient.

554
00:33:48,943 --> 00:33:50,361
Bit sentimental, I suppose.

555
00:33:52,739 --> 00:33:54,866
But you need to find your own reason too.

556
00:33:56,951 --> 00:33:58,494
So that when you're working late

557
00:33:59,328 --> 00:34:00,830
and getting treated like shit,

558
00:34:01,831 --> 00:34:04,250
you'll always remember why you do this.

559
00:34:07,587 --> 00:34:09,756
You know,
there will be greater difficulties

560
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:11,007
for you in the future.

561
00:34:12,508 --> 00:34:14,844
And without a reason
to continue this journey,

562
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:18,306
you won't survive.

563
00:34:22,101 --> 00:34:24,437
This won't be the last time
I hear this, right?

564
00:34:25,772 --> 00:34:26,689
Yeah, right.

565
00:34:30,985 --> 00:34:34,363
Well… I'm gonna get some rest.

566
00:34:35,114 --> 00:34:35,948
Okay.

567
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:38,284
I'm a little tired today.

568
00:34:44,665 --> 00:34:45,583
Number One.

569
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:48,544
Yes?

570
00:34:48,628 --> 00:34:50,171
You have nothing to apologize for.

571
00:34:51,297 --> 00:34:53,132
You're still searching for your purpose.

572
00:34:53,216 --> 00:34:54,926
Just haven't found your "why" yet.

573
00:34:59,388 --> 00:35:00,765
Ugh, sit.

574
00:35:00,848 --> 00:35:02,183
Hurry up and finish that.

575
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:04,393
Eating is part of your work too,
all right?

576
00:35:08,397 --> 00:35:09,440
Yes, Dr. Baek.

577
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:42,557
Why aren't you speaking?

578
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:47,770
Why aren't you spilling the beans
on Baek Kang-hyuk's controversial past?

579
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,773
Or are you already on his side now?

580
00:35:50,857 --> 00:35:52,358
No way.

581
00:35:52,441 --> 00:35:53,442
Then why?

582
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:57,905
Jae-hun, let me off the hook this once.

583
00:35:57,989 --> 00:36:00,366
You know very well
just how loyal to you I've been.

584
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:02,535
Oh, I know. Mm.

585
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:04,036
And that

586
00:36:05,371 --> 00:36:08,457
is why I've allocated plenty
of funding to colorectal surgery.

587
00:36:08,541 --> 00:36:10,168
It's because I've had your back.

588
00:36:11,627 --> 00:36:13,296
I see that you've changed though.

589
00:36:13,379 --> 00:36:14,630
What?

590
00:36:15,464 --> 00:36:17,049
Okay. I got it.

591
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:20,303
The extra funding trauma surgery wants,

592
00:36:20,386 --> 00:36:22,805
I know exactly where
I'll get that money now.

593
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:26,475
From colorectal surgery.

594
00:36:27,059 --> 00:36:29,645
Oh, no. Seriously?
Why are you saying all that?

595
00:36:32,231 --> 00:36:33,191
Listen to me.

596
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:39,071
Did I… or did I not tell you
to choose your allegiances wisely?

597
00:36:40,364 --> 00:36:42,950
Seeing as you are dead set on this matter,

598
00:36:44,243 --> 00:36:45,494
I guess I have no choice.

599
00:36:49,999 --> 00:36:50,833
Please.

600
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:53,336
Let's hear what you've got.

601
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,922
His weakness.

602
00:36:56,923 --> 00:36:58,216
I can never tell you.

603
00:37:03,304 --> 00:37:04,222
I won't tell you.

604
00:37:05,097 --> 00:37:07,308
Hey, asshole,
are you toying with me right now?

605
00:37:07,391 --> 00:37:09,685
No, I'm choosing my allegiances wisely.

606
00:37:09,769 --> 00:37:11,729
He saved my only daughter's life,

607
00:37:11,812 --> 00:37:13,940
and I could never betray
someone like that.

608
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:18,069
You're my friend, and yet,
you didn't even pay her a visit.

609
00:37:25,034 --> 00:37:25,868
Huh.

610
00:37:27,536 --> 00:37:29,413
So this is how you wanna do this?

611
00:37:33,834 --> 00:37:36,254
Then I'll take my leave,
Director Choi.

612
00:37:36,337 --> 00:37:38,047
Oh, right. You may leave.

613
00:37:40,424 --> 00:37:41,342
Director Hong.

614
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:43,219
Right.

615
00:37:59,235 --> 00:38:01,112
- What is this?
- Take a look, sir.

616
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:03,990
We'll speak after you've had a look.

617
00:38:06,909 --> 00:38:10,538
The patient's family has requested
a thorough investigation into the facts.

618
00:38:10,621 --> 00:38:13,666
It's always a risk
with these sorts of things.

619
00:38:13,749 --> 00:38:15,584
And after all of that bragging…

620
00:38:16,085 --> 00:38:18,921
This has become
a real headache, hasn't it?

621
00:38:19,005 --> 00:38:19,880
Not quite.

622
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:25,011
Now is the ideal opportunity
to get rid of this guy forever.

623
00:38:28,347 --> 00:38:30,683
That would be a stretch, don't you think?

624
00:38:30,766 --> 00:38:32,226
Our reputation is…

625
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:35,396
You think I haven't considered that?

626
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:40,860
You have a plan for everything, don't you?

627
00:38:41,527 --> 00:38:43,529
Hmm?

628
00:38:50,745 --> 00:38:53,456
Stab wound patient.
15 centimeters in length.

629
00:38:53,539 --> 00:38:55,708
Patient is conscious,
but the blade is so embedded

630
00:38:55,791 --> 00:38:57,918
that they weren't able
to perform any first aid.

631
00:38:58,002 --> 00:38:59,670
We're going
straight into surgery?

632
00:38:59,754 --> 00:39:02,548
CT first. We need to check the stab wound.

633
00:39:06,093 --> 00:39:07,803
Get ready for surgery and thoracotomy.

634
00:39:07,887 --> 00:39:09,263
Nurse Jang-mi.

635
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:10,598
What?

636
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:14,185
Ah…

637
00:39:14,769 --> 00:39:16,187
I can't help but smile.

638
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:19,106
It's like a weight's been lifted off
my shoulders. Oh, this feels great.

639
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:20,608
You sure you don't have to go?

640
00:39:20,691 --> 00:39:22,526
I'm telling you no.

641
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:24,445
Uh, they said it was urgent though.

642
00:39:24,528 --> 00:39:25,571
Not my problem.

643
00:39:26,072 --> 00:39:28,991
- Park Gyeong.
- Is it the trauma center?

644
00:39:31,327 --> 00:39:32,870
There an emergency surgery?

645
00:39:32,953 --> 00:39:34,663
This little asshole here.

646
00:39:35,247 --> 00:39:36,332
Hey.

647
00:39:36,415 --> 00:39:37,583
Hey.

648
00:39:38,834 --> 00:39:39,752
Don't go.

649
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:47,593
That might have come out wrong.

650
00:39:48,177 --> 00:39:49,345
I'm saying don't go.

651
00:39:55,309 --> 00:39:57,228
What? Out of the way!

652
00:39:57,311 --> 00:39:58,145
- Oh!
- Move! Move it!

653
00:39:58,229 --> 00:40:01,232
- Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
- Whoa. Stop. Stop.

654
00:40:03,317 --> 00:40:07,029
We have orders to restrict Dr. Baek
from entering the premises.

655
00:40:07,113 --> 00:40:08,197
- What?
- Huh?

656
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,198
Why?

657
00:40:09,281 --> 00:40:12,076
It's hospital guidelines
to suspend activities

658
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:14,662
for any staff suspected of malpractice.

659
00:40:18,499 --> 00:40:20,209
- <i>Malpractice?</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>

660
00:40:20,292 --> 00:40:23,212
<i>Apparently, he performed surgery inside</i>
<i>a moving ambulance.</i>

661
00:40:23,295 --> 00:40:24,880
<i>Well, the family found out.</i>

662
00:40:24,964 --> 00:40:26,674
<i>They're now considering</i>
<i>talking to the press</i>

663
00:40:26,757 --> 00:40:29,343
<i>and filing a lawsuit</i>
<i>for excessive treatment.</i>

664
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:31,762
<i>So, Baek Kang-hyuk is done for.</i>

665
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:36,392
Actually, I think
you're mistaken. It's not true.

666
00:40:36,475 --> 00:40:38,686
I was… I was the witness.
Yeah. So move aside.

667
00:40:38,769 --> 00:40:40,688
- It's an urgent situation here.
- Block him.

668
00:40:40,771 --> 00:40:43,566
Out of the way!
Otherwise, this patient will die!

669
00:40:43,649 --> 00:40:44,567
Stand back!

670
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:45,818
- Let us in!
- Let go!

671
00:40:45,901 --> 00:40:48,446
Dr. Baek! They won't let us into the OR!

672
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:50,906
It's Director Hong.

673
00:40:55,494 --> 00:40:56,996
For now, just let us through.

674
00:40:57,079 --> 00:40:59,707
You can confirm all this again later.
Move aside.

675
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:01,792
Move aside. Come on, please. Please!

676
00:41:01,876 --> 00:41:03,085
Come on, let us through!

677
00:41:12,428 --> 00:41:15,264
Move aside, will you?
Come on, please. Just move.

678
00:41:15,764 --> 00:41:16,640
Number One.

679
00:41:19,977 --> 00:41:22,438
Do whatever you need to do and get a CT.

680
00:41:22,938 --> 00:41:24,315
You can go inside, right?

681
00:41:24,398 --> 00:41:25,733
M… me?

682
00:41:26,859 --> 00:41:28,027
- Dr. Baek, hold on.
- Hey, wait.

683
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:30,946
Dr. Baek, we could get a CT.
What about the surgery?
