1
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:03,391
Stay calm! Keep your head down!

2
00:03:03,975 --> 00:03:06,102
It's okay. Stay calm. It's all right.

3
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:08,229
It's okay. It's okay.

4
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:10,356
Calm down. Calm down.

5
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:20,575
Malak!

6
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:22,911
- You made it!
- Go.

7
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:25,955
Prepare for transfusion. Hurry!

8
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:27,582
Where are the antibiotics?

9
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:32,689
THE TRAUMA CODE: HEROES ON CALL

10
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,402
<i>Now to some unfortunate news.</i>

11
00:04:37,485 --> 00:04:39,904
<i>It's been reported</i>
<i>that a hit-and-run victim died</i>

12
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:43,283
<i>while being transported</i>
<i>to the hospital early yesterday morning.</i>

13
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:45,076
<i>The ambulance transporting the victim</i>

14
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:48,371
<i>had to visit as many</i>
<i>as five hospitals that day.</i>

15
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:51,457
<i>Ultimately, the final hospital</i>
<i>they arrived at had no choice</i>

16
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:53,126
<i>but to pronounce them dead.</i>

17
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:55,878
<i>Furthermore, it has</i>
<i>come to light that already this year,</i>

18
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:58,923
<i>there have been 13 similar cases</i>
<i>across the country.</i>

19
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,591
<i>Given the number of such cases,</i>

20
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:03,970
<i>there have been growing concerns</i>
<i>that South Korea's trauma response system</i>

21
00:05:04,053 --> 00:05:05,555
<i>may not be adequately functioning.</i>

22
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:07,598
A trauma center
is a specialized facility

23
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:10,852
that treats emergency patients
with critical injuries.

24
00:05:11,352 --> 00:05:13,896
Trauma centers are designed
to go beyond the treatment scope

25
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:16,149
of our general emergency rooms.

26
00:05:16,232 --> 00:05:19,110
The Ministry of Health and Welfare
plans to invest generously

27
00:05:19,193 --> 00:05:22,905
over the next five years
to upgrade and expand these facilities.

28
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:24,615
We will ensure
they have adequate staffing,

29
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:27,660
as well as more facilities
and state-of-the-art equipment.

30
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:31,164
All of these deaths… are senseless!

31
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:35,043
But this chaos will stop now that
I'm minister! I give you my word!

32
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:37,253
MINISTER OF HEALTH AND WELFARE
KANG MYEONG-HUI

33
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:39,756
I said all that at my swearing in.

34
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:41,466
Hmm?

35
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:45,511
But just look at
the current state of things.

36
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:50,558
Take a look at yourselves!

37
00:05:50,641 --> 00:05:54,187
You're directors of the most prestigious
hospitals in the country.

38
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:56,397
So then why can't you do better?
Why, why, why?

39
00:05:59,275 --> 00:06:00,777
Director Choi Jo-eun?

40
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,071
Yes? Yes, Minister?

41
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:07,700
Hankuk National University.
You received funding. Tell us.

42
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:09,744
How much did you accept
for the Trauma Unit?

43
00:06:09,827 --> 00:06:10,745
Oh, uh…

44
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:14,123
Ten billion won!
It was ten billion won!

45
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:16,417
We've gotten our money's worth
out of that?

46
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:17,418
If it were up to me,

47
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:20,838
the Trauma Unit would be running smoothly
as we speak.

48
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:22,006
And yet…

49
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:25,093
However, there is only
one person in the country

50
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:27,178
that's a bona fide trauma specialist.

51
00:06:27,261 --> 00:06:28,679
And he collapsed recently.

52
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:29,597
Yes.

53
00:06:30,431 --> 00:06:32,100
- He was being overworked.
- Exactly.

54
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:36,020
Now, before that, Dr. Kwon had done
a brilliant job leading the Trauma Unit.

55
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:38,356
But now our hands are tied, unfortunately.

56
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:41,484
Everyone witnessed
Dr. Kwon Hak-su's collapse that day,

57
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:44,654
and we haven't found anyone else
who is willing to take on that position.

58
00:06:45,863 --> 00:06:47,407
I know somebody.

59
00:06:48,991 --> 00:06:50,701
You do?

60
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:54,956
HANKUK NATIONAL UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

61
00:06:58,459 --> 00:07:00,253
<i>I've invited him here.</i>

62
00:07:00,336 --> 00:07:04,882
<i>He's brilliant at what he does,</i>
<i>and he's come from very far away.</i>

63
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:07,760
<i>He should be arriving soon.</i>

64
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:11,556
<i>Pediatrics Dr. An Jeong-won,</i>

65
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:13,349
<i>please come to OR 12.</i>

66
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:15,309
<i>I repeat, Dr. An Jeong-won…</i>

67
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:19,522
<i>Dr. Kim Da-yun, please come to OR 9.</i>

68
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:27,488
{\an8}<i>Dr. Kwon Hak-su of</i>
<i>Hankuk National University Hospital,</i>

69
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:32,118
{\an8}<i>known as a pioneer in the field of trauma,</i>
<i>has reportedly collapsed due to fatigue.</i>

70
00:07:32,201 --> 00:07:35,121
<i>Dr. Kwon,</i>
<i>the lone specialist in the field…</i>

71
00:07:35,204 --> 00:07:37,248
More like severely overworked.

72
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:41,252
<i>…ever since he set foot</i>
<i>in Hankuk National University Hospital.</i>

73
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:44,338
<i>Dr. Kwon's excessive workload</i>
<i>has been attributed</i>

74
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:46,966
<i>to the lack of</i>
<i>a stable working environment.</i>

75
00:07:47,049 --> 00:07:48,426
Yang Jae-won of general surgery.

76
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:51,179
<i>Dr. Yang, a trauma patient</i>
<i>is arriving by ambulance.</i>

77
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:54,223
<i>Stab wound to the left upper abdomen,</i>
<i>and unconscious.</i>

78
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:01,481
<i>Patient number 37?</i>

79
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:04,400
Can't get a blood pressure
reading? What about a central line?

80
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:06,152
I'm coming right now!

81
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:48,444
<i>Dr. No Seung-hyeon</i>
<i>of neurosurgery, please come to the ER.</i>

82
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:53,824
<i>Once again, Dr. No Seung-hyeon</i>
<i>of neurosurgery, please come to the ER.</i>

83
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,249
REGIONAL EMERGENCY MEDICAL CENTER

84
00:09:05,002 --> 00:09:07,129
{\an8}New patient.
Stab wound to the left abdomen.

85
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:09,006
{\an8}- Resuscitation room.
- Okay.

86
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:11,259
BP is dropping. It's at 60.

87
00:09:11,342 --> 00:09:13,636
Let's intubate.
Careful not to touch the knife.

88
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:15,263
- Yes, sir.
- One, two, three.

89
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:20,851
{\an8}Heart rate is dangerously low.

90
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:22,311
{\an8}UNKNOWN MALE
UPPER ABDOMINAL STAB WOUND

91
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:26,107
{\an8}At least there isn't much
bleeding with the knife still in place.

92
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:28,526
{\an8}- Check his BP.
- Right.

93
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:33,864
Be careful cutting around that.
Gotta keep the knife in place.

94
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:36,033
- Yes, sir.
- Intubation is done.

95
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:38,995
- BP's still dropping. It's 50!
- 50?!

96
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:41,747
All right, well,
he needs a CT scan, so let's prepare.

97
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:44,083
- Yes, sir.
- Just… just… just wait!

98
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:45,001
Just wait.

99
00:09:46,335 --> 00:09:47,461
What is this?

100
00:09:49,046 --> 00:09:50,214
It's a bruise.

101
00:09:52,174 --> 00:09:53,634
- Stethoscope.
- Here.

102
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:11,902
<i>There's blood accumulating</i>
<i>in the pericardium.</i>

103
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:13,738
<i>It's putting pressure on the heart.</i>

104
00:10:16,824 --> 00:10:19,702
{\an8}Cardiac tamponade.
Call cardiothoracic surgery.

105
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:23,289
{\an8}They'll be able to drain the fluid,
so prepare a spinal needle and ultrasound.

106
00:10:23,372 --> 00:10:24,290
{\an8}Yes, Doctor.

107
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:26,000
Quickly. Come on!

108
00:10:34,383 --> 00:10:37,553
Everyone in cardiothoracic is in surgery.
They'll be another two hours.

109
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:40,389
- They know it's cardiac tamponade?
- They're working on a heart rupture.

110
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:43,476
Ah! Jesus, you're kidding.

111
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:47,313
<i>What do I do?</i>
<i>Should I do the puncture myself?</i>

112
00:10:47,396 --> 00:10:49,440
<i>What if his heart isn't the issue?</i>

113
00:10:49,523 --> 00:10:51,692
<i>Shouldn't we get a CT scan first</i>
<i>to be sure?</i>

114
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:54,070
Uh, better do a scan.

115
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:56,405
His BP is getting too low.
It's 40!

116
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:59,200
- Uh, I'll…
- Shouldn't we do the puncture?

117
00:10:59,283 --> 00:11:00,117
Doctor!

118
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:02,828
All right! I'll do it. Yeah. Pass it here.

119
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:05,164
- All right. I'm doing it.
- Right.

120
00:11:05,247 --> 00:11:07,333
- I'm gonna do it. Okay.
- Yeah.

121
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:09,752
- Okay. Here I go.
- Right.

122
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:34,694
The hell are you?

123
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:40,700
{\an8}Xiphoid Process.
45 degrees to the left.

124
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:43,786
{\an8}You can't do that. You…

125
00:11:51,627 --> 00:11:52,586
Huh?

126
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:08,144
Huh?

127
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:10,479
- Uh…
- Whoa!

128
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:12,732
His BP is stabilizing.

129
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:15,067
Huh? Oh.

130
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:16,777
Oh!

131
00:12:18,195 --> 00:12:19,405
Who are you?

132
00:12:20,197 --> 00:12:24,326
Hey. You're an emergency doctor,
and you can't even do a centesis properly?

133
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:25,327
What?

134
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:27,496
My specialty is the anus.

135
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:30,708
So why are you in the ER?

136
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:33,544
Because I'm on call.

137
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:38,382
We take turns. It goes general,
cardiothoracic, then neurosurgery.

138
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:39,592
Gotta be kidding me.

139
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:42,052
Uh, what?

140
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:43,262
- What?
- Wha…

141
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:45,139
Hey, wait.

142
00:12:45,222 --> 00:12:46,766
Are you even a doctor?

143
00:12:47,558 --> 00:12:51,145
Whatever the case, I appreciate your help,
but you can't be in here.

144
00:12:51,228 --> 00:12:52,480
This is my territory.

145
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:54,523
I haven't finished yet.

146
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:57,318
What? Just who are you, anyway?

147
00:12:57,401 --> 00:13:00,112
Well, as of today,
I'm this hospital's trauma surgeon.

148
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:02,281
What? That can't be.

149
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:12,166
Oh. Are… are you the one
taking over Dr. Kwon's p… position?

150
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,463
This isn't your territory.

151
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:19,215
It's mine now.

152
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:26,931
I'm Baek Kang-hyuk.

153
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:30,309
Hey, Anus.

154
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:32,853
What's your plan now?

155
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:36,524
Uh… I'm Yang Jae-won. That's my name.

156
00:13:36,607 --> 00:13:38,484
I'll decide when to call you by name.

157
00:13:39,109 --> 00:13:40,528
So what will you do now?

158
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:41,987
Do now?

159
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:45,950
Uh, the cardiac tamponade's been treated.

160
00:13:46,033 --> 00:13:48,160
So now we need to do a CT scan?

161
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:49,495
CT scan.

162
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:55,334
There was a… broken knife blade
found at the scene today.

163
00:13:57,962 --> 00:13:59,129
<i>Hey, Anus.</i>

164
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:01,841
<i>It's important to assess</i>
<i>the patient's current condition,</i>

165
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:05,719
<i>but it's also important to understand</i>
<i>the circumstances of the accident too.</i>

166
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:08,597
<i>- Do you understand?</i>
- <i>Pardon? Yes, I know that.</i>

167
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:09,557
<i>Good.</i>

168
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:13,060
<i>So have you established where</i>
<i>and how the patient was stabbed?</i>

169
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:14,645
<i>No.</i>

170
00:14:15,145 --> 00:14:17,189
Gang-related? And the weapon?

171
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:19,733
Sashimi knife.
Stab wound to the upper abdomen.

172
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:20,901
Huh?

173
00:14:21,735 --> 00:14:24,947
Based on that, I surmised that
the stab wound wasn't too serious,

174
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,657
so I just pulled the knife out.

175
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:27,741
<i>What happened?</i>

176
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:30,160
<i>Well, there wasn't</i>
<i>as much bleeding as I expected.</i>

177
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:33,247
<i>That's right. He was stabbed</i>
<i>with a knife that was already broken,</i>

178
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:34,748
<i>so it's a shallow wound.</i>

179
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:36,750
<i>Which means, what?</i>

180
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:41,630
His BP's going up and down.
He's completely unresponsive.

181
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:43,924
The cardiac tamponade
is to blame for that.

182
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:50,931
What's the next step, then?

183
00:14:51,515 --> 00:14:53,142
The next step. Well…

184
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:57,229
- Hmm. Give me the gauze.
- Here.

185
00:14:57,313 --> 00:14:59,815
Gauze? Why… why do we need gauze?

186
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:02,401
The patient still hasn't
regained consciousness.

187
00:15:02,484 --> 00:15:04,403
That means there's also an issue there.

188
00:15:04,486 --> 00:15:06,113
It's gonna burst right now.

189
00:15:06,196 --> 00:15:07,948
What? What do you mean it's gonna--

190
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:10,659
What the hell?

191
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:12,995
- Prep for surgery immediately.
- Yes, sir.

192
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:14,288
Surgery?

193
00:15:17,499 --> 00:15:18,876
<i>The hand of God?</i>

194
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:21,378
Guess he's able to save patients
from the brink of death

195
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:24,048
with nothing more
than a scalpel or something.

196
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:27,343
I've never heard of him.
Maybe he didn't go to Hankuk University.

197
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:30,387
- Did he study abroad?
- No, Muhan University.

198
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:32,222
What? Seriously?

199
00:15:32,848 --> 00:15:33,933
Muhan University?

200
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:36,894
Even so, he spent time abroad as well.

201
00:15:36,977 --> 00:15:38,062
Where?

202
00:15:38,145 --> 00:15:40,522
Doctors for International Peace.

203
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:43,943
Thought you were being serious.
That's a volunteer organization.

204
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:45,778
And it's hardly important work.

205
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:47,905
I know. He's a legend, nonetheless.

206
00:15:47,988 --> 00:15:49,740
He spent around six years in Syria,

207
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:52,493
encountering every single
kind of trauma that there is.

208
00:15:52,576 --> 00:15:54,411
You're saying he did grunt work?

209
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:58,207
How'd he manage to get a job
at a trauma center, then? Huh?

210
00:15:58,290 --> 00:15:59,750
There's only one answer.

211
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:01,251
Nepotism, right?

212
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:04,254
Someone high up gave him a position here.

213
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:05,673
So who was it, huh?

214
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:08,050
The one who brought this guy
to our hospital?

215
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:09,093
Kang Myeong-hui.

216
00:16:09,176 --> 00:16:10,094
Kang Myeong-hui?

217
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:11,637
Hey, wait a minute.

218
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,180
Kang Myeong-hui?

219
00:16:13,263 --> 00:16:15,891
The… the one I already know?
That Kang Myeong-hui?

220
00:16:22,272 --> 00:16:23,899
<i>The Minister of Health and Welfare</i>

221
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:27,152
<i>is appearing at the appointment ceremony</i>
<i>of an attending physician?</i>

222
00:16:27,736 --> 00:16:31,073
<i>I don't know. Kah Myeong-hui,</i>
<i>Kang Myeong-hui… whatever her name is.</i>

223
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:32,825
<i>I can't be bothered. Ugh!</i>

224
00:16:32,908 --> 00:16:36,745
<i>What does she expect to accomplish</i>
<i>by appointing a single doctor?</i>

225
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:39,748
<i>Oh, this whole thing is a disaster.</i>
<i>It really is. </i>

226
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:45,838
EMERGENCY ROOM, HNUH

227
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:48,882
- Yeah, what?
- <i>Dr. Hwang, this is the ER.</i>

228
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:51,135
<i>You're the anesthesiologist</i>
<i>on call for the Trauma Unit.</i>

229
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:54,221
Just transfer it to another hospital.
I'm not doing that.

230
00:16:54,304 --> 00:16:56,390
<i>Uh, Dr. Hwang,</i>
<i>the patient is too critical to do that.</i>

231
00:16:56,473 --> 00:16:58,183
You're asking me to come in right now?

232
00:16:58,267 --> 00:16:59,852
Uh, no, it's not that--

233
00:16:59,935 --> 00:17:02,646
<i>- I'm off in this afternoon.</i>
- What's going on here?

234
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:07,276
<i>You should've given me a heads-up</i>
<i>so I could be prepared</i>

235
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:09,486
if you thought there'd be surgeries today.

236
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:13,866
You haven't figured that out yet?
You're a fourth-year resident! Come on!

237
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:17,995
When are you going to learn, huh?
Time is running out!

238
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:20,205
Ugh, son of a bitch.

239
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:21,707
- You whiny little…
- What?

240
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:23,751
What'd you just say? Who is this?

241
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:25,711
<i>I'm the attending, asshole.</i>

242
00:17:25,794 --> 00:17:26,837
Attending?

243
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,464
<i>Who the hell do you think you are</i>

244
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:31,925
complaining that you should get a heads-up
when it's an emergency?!

245
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:33,802
No, I was just trying to say…

246
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:37,056
- I was just on call yesterday--
- Cut the crap, and get the hell over here.

247
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:40,476
If you're not there by the time
I get to the OR, you're finished.

248
00:17:41,351 --> 00:17:42,519
Are we clear?!

249
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:44,354
Yes, sir. I'm sorry.

250
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:46,690
What the hell?

251
00:17:56,116 --> 00:17:57,201
Dr. Baek!

252
00:17:57,284 --> 00:18:01,413
Uh, well, all the ORs on the main floor
are being used for surgeries.

253
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:03,665
Son of a…

254
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:08,337
However, the emergency OR is open.
Right here.

255
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:23,894
Uh, it's been renovated
with the available funding.

256
00:18:23,977 --> 00:18:26,355
What a pathetic excuse of an OR.

257
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:27,773
Is it functional?

258
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:30,943
Well,
it's never really been used.

259
00:18:31,026 --> 00:18:33,112
Who's the current head of Trauma Surgery?

260
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:35,364
There isn't one.

261
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:39,618
So this entire place is a disaster? Yeesh.

262
00:18:39,701 --> 00:18:42,454
Well, the emergency department
has been supportive.

263
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:44,248
They've helped out here and there.

264
00:18:44,331 --> 00:18:46,834
Jesus. This place is being run
like a local deli.

265
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:50,462
All right, I'm here!

266
00:18:51,046 --> 00:18:52,673
- Anesthesiology?
- Yes.

267
00:18:52,756 --> 00:18:55,551
It was… me on the phone earlier.

268
00:18:57,511 --> 00:18:58,387
Hey, Buzz Cut.

269
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:02,015
Save the patient first.

270
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:04,184
Yes, sir.

271
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:40,846
Scalpel.

272
00:20:04,244 --> 00:20:06,788
Hey, Anus.
You're pretty quick on your feet.

273
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:09,625
This is nothing.
By the way, my name isn't "Anus," it's--

274
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:11,293
Well, here it is.

275
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:17,090
A branch of the splenic artery was cut.
That explains all the blood.

276
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:18,800
Oh.

277
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:19,760
"Oh"?

278
00:20:19,843 --> 00:20:22,095
- Uh…
- So tie it off already.

279
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:24,598
Right.
I'll tie it off right away, but…

280
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:27,059
Where do I tie it off?

281
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:31,271
You can't see it?

282
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:34,900
Right angle.

283
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:40,405
Well, I suppose it's not visible
to normal people.

284
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:48,413
Oh! Oh!

285
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:52,292
- You gonna tie it off?
- Yes! Can I get a 3-0 Black Silk?

286
00:21:02,886 --> 00:21:03,929
Hold on.

287
00:21:07,182 --> 00:21:09,643
Dr. Baek, there's more blood
oozing out than before.

288
00:21:09,726 --> 00:21:11,979
This bastard can't be serious.

289
00:21:12,062 --> 00:21:14,147
- Did… did I make a mistake?
- Hey!

290
00:21:17,567 --> 00:21:18,402
Yes?

291
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:20,696
{\an8}- Did you use inotropics?
- Yes.

292
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:23,532
{\an8}Well, his blood pressure
was only 60 over 40--

293
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:25,033
So you used inotropics?

294
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:27,202
This patient had centesis
for a cardiac tamponade!

295
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:30,664
Yes, well, I just…
It was only 60 over 40.

296
00:21:30,747 --> 00:21:33,750
So you took a shortcut,
and you fucked us over.

297
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:36,753
Hey, Resident,
go get a different anesthesiologist.

298
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:40,257
Dr. Baek.
I think you're being a bit unreasonable.

299
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:41,383
Unreason--

300
00:21:43,593 --> 00:21:46,513
You screwed this patient over
all for your own convenience.

301
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:50,809
You're not even a doctor,
so you shouldn't be in the OR. Yeah?

302
00:21:55,522 --> 00:21:56,690
We need to check on the heart,

303
00:21:56,773 --> 00:21:59,401
so let's stitch him up
and prepare for a thoracotomy.

304
00:21:59,901 --> 00:22:01,111
Yes, Doctor.

305
00:22:11,788 --> 00:22:14,791
Oh shit. He really threw that guy out?

306
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:16,293
I swear he's crazy.

307
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:19,755
This is the top surgery department
in the country.

308
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:23,467
Where does some random general surgeon
get off embarrassing an anesthesiologist?

309
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:24,384
Come on.

310
00:22:25,552 --> 00:22:29,348
All right. So… who, then?

311
00:22:29,931 --> 00:22:31,475
You know exactly who.

312
00:22:32,142 --> 00:22:33,352
Park.

313
00:22:44,488 --> 00:22:46,907
This is anesthesiology resident
Park Gyeong-won.

314
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:48,617
<i>Park, it's an emergency.</i>

315
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,577
<i>Get yourself to the emergency OR.</i>

316
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:53,955
I'm studying right now.
Could it be someone else?

317
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:56,458
<i>Hey, Park, aren't you a fellow here?</i>

318
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:58,251
<i>I said it's an emergency surgery!</i>

319
00:22:58,335 --> 00:22:59,544
<i>How dare you!</i>

320
00:23:04,674 --> 00:23:07,511
SURGERY IN PROGRESS

321
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,482
- By the way…
- Yes?

322
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:22,776
Not you, the anesthesiologist.

323
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:24,528
Yes?

324
00:23:25,028 --> 00:23:28,407
Did you lower the heart rate
on purpose? It's moving less.

325
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:31,284
{\an8}I figured
it could be a rupture.

326
00:23:35,956 --> 00:23:37,707
Your name, what is it?

327
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:41,628
Park Gyeong-won.

328
00:23:45,215 --> 00:23:46,716
It is a rupture.

329
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,928
Now, let's speed up.

330
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,805
3-0, please.

331
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:03,024
<i>Your call</i>
<i>could not be connected. At the tone…</i>

332
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:06,069
Where on earth could he be?
He won't even pick up his phone.

333
00:24:06,987 --> 00:24:08,572
The minister has arrived.

334
00:24:09,823 --> 00:24:11,783
APPOINTMENT CEREMONY
ATTENDING TRAUMA SURGEON BAEK KANG-HYUK

335
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:13,410
Hello there.

336
00:24:14,995 --> 00:24:16,997
Hello.

337
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:19,666
Madam Minister,
you made time to come all this way.

338
00:24:19,749 --> 00:24:21,543
- It's an honor to have you.
- Don't mention it.

339
00:24:21,626 --> 00:24:25,213
I have very high hopes
for Dr. Baek Kang-hyuk's performance here.

340
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:27,841
Actually, Dr. Baek isn't here yet.

341
00:24:27,924 --> 00:24:30,260
Oh. Well, let's wait a while, then.

342
00:24:30,343 --> 00:24:32,554
- Is this my seat? Okay.
- Yes, this one. Yes.

343
00:24:32,637 --> 00:24:34,514
Right. Hello. Take a seat.

344
00:24:34,598 --> 00:24:35,849
Yes, take a seat.

345
00:24:43,565 --> 00:24:45,901
CURRENT TIME - DURATION OF SURGERY

346
00:24:59,289 --> 00:25:02,959
- What's taking him so long?
- He couldn't make it here on time?

347
00:25:07,714 --> 00:25:09,257
All right. Cut.

348
00:25:11,301 --> 00:25:13,220
Okay, let's close the chest now.

349
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:24,481
Done.

350
00:25:32,656 --> 00:25:34,407
One hour, 42 minutes.

351
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:43,458
This kind of operation
usually takes much longer.

352
00:25:44,417 --> 00:25:46,670
- Oh, Jesus!
- You think that was fast?

353
00:25:47,295 --> 00:25:50,465
Should've been over in an hour and a half.
Took 12 minutes longer than that.

354
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:52,634
No thanks to your awful assistance.

355
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:54,719
It wasn't awful.

356
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:57,847
I'm running late now
to my appointment ceremony.

357
00:25:57,931 --> 00:25:59,474
Wonder if they started?

358
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:00,392
What?

359
00:26:01,601 --> 00:26:04,604
I'm late already.
Might as well see the patient wake up.

360
00:26:04,688 --> 00:26:08,400
Aren't you going to go?
It's your appointment ceremony.

361
00:26:08,483 --> 00:26:10,318
I should see him first though.

362
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:13,196
I'll handle it.
Don't even worry about it. You should go.

363
00:26:19,786 --> 00:26:21,454
How strange.

364
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,374
- Let's wait a bit longer.
- Of course.

365
00:26:27,043 --> 00:26:29,921
I understand why Minister Kang
recommended Baek Kang-hyuk.

366
00:26:30,755 --> 00:26:32,507
Must be preparing for an audit.

367
00:26:33,174 --> 00:26:35,468
The director must've said yes.

368
00:26:35,552 --> 00:26:38,638
So he could put
a no-name Muhan University grad in,

369
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:41,558
all for the sake of maintaining
the Trauma Unit.

370
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:44,853
The thing I can't wrap my head around is,

371
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:49,107
why come to our hospital now, huh?

372
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:51,192
Must know he'd be an outcast here.

373
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:02,287
Does he not see the time?

374
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:05,665
He's here. He's finally here. Yes.

375
00:27:06,666 --> 00:27:09,377
- That is so rude.
- How inconsiderate.

376
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:12,464
- Uh, Dr. Baek. Dr. Baek, you're late.
- Yes, I'm late.

377
00:27:12,547 --> 00:27:14,758
I think it's best
if you start by apologizing.

378
00:27:15,342 --> 00:27:18,053
Oh, right.
You should greet the minister first.

379
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:20,013
- Oh, it's all right.
- Huh? Yeah, yeah.

380
00:27:20,096 --> 00:27:21,306
She says it's all right.

381
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:27,729
Hi, everyone. I'm Baek Kang-hyuk,
the new trauma attending.

382
00:27:29,522 --> 00:27:32,901
The director would like me to start
by apologizing to you all.

383
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:34,903
But I don't think I'll do that.

384
00:27:37,447 --> 00:27:41,284
And honestly, I think I'm the one
who should be receiving an apology.

385
00:27:49,417 --> 00:27:51,836
I'm here because they offered me
the attending position

386
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:54,214
and said
they'd reorganize the Trauma Unit.

387
00:27:54,297 --> 00:27:59,177
However, it seems like what they wanted
was a figurehead and nothing more.

388
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:04,641
In any case, the reason why
I've come here to your hospital

389
00:28:05,433 --> 00:28:07,519
is so that the Trauma Team…

390
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:13,608
…can finally be shut down.

391
00:28:18,154 --> 00:28:19,280
He being serious?

392
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:22,450
Dr. Baek, wait. What is this?

393
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:25,036
- Dr. Baek. Can we talk… privately?
- Hold up a minute.

394
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:26,663
Uh, yes?

395
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:33,420
Uh, Baek Kang-hyuk, is it?

396
00:28:34,003 --> 00:28:35,004
Right.

397
00:28:35,505 --> 00:28:38,216
I think what you're saying
is completely inappropriate.

398
00:28:38,299 --> 00:28:39,592
Especially on your first day.

399
00:28:39,676 --> 00:28:43,304
"I understand it'll be difficult,
but I will do my very best."

400
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:44,931
Wouldn't that be more fitting?

401
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:50,979
Ah, I'm the attending colorectal surgeon
and head of surgery, Dr. Han Yu-rim.

402
00:28:51,062 --> 00:28:52,021
Nice to meet you.

403
00:28:52,605 --> 00:28:53,940
Right. Dr. Hang Yu-rim.

404
00:28:54,023 --> 00:28:57,861
No, it's not "Hang" Yu-rim.
It's Han Yu-rim. Han Yu-rim.

405
00:28:57,944 --> 00:28:59,571
Thank you for your kind words.

406
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:04,284
Uh, I actually tested the waters of
your hospital right before this ceremony.

407
00:29:04,367 --> 00:29:07,120
It's a complete disaster.

408
00:29:08,121 --> 00:29:10,457
You've never had
a dedicated trauma department,

409
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:15,295
and I was told that all the other doctors
just take turns being on call.

410
00:29:15,837 --> 00:29:18,631
- With no accountability to anyone.
- Dr. Baek, I must insist--

411
00:29:18,715 --> 00:29:20,884
You don't know a thing
about trauma, do you?

412
00:29:20,967 --> 00:29:24,721
The colorectal surgeon on call
was clueless, yet he continued to work.

413
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:26,473
What?

414
00:29:27,474 --> 00:29:30,977
I've never seen such sincere,
such earnest efforts

415
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:34,147
to ensure that all your patients
will not survive.

416
00:29:35,315 --> 00:29:37,317
Absolutely ridiculous. I mean…

417
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:40,695
This system… this system is a train wreck.

418
00:29:42,489 --> 00:29:46,034
So, of course, you're making
a complete and total mess of it.

419
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:47,535
We've heard more than enough.

420
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:49,996
Hey, Baek Kang-hyuk! Watch your mouth!

421
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:52,457
Who the hell are you calling a quack?

422
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:54,167
Where do you get the right to say that?

423
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:59,130
I refuse to just sit around and watch
someone kill their patient like that.

424
00:29:59,214 --> 00:30:01,925
Which is why I did the surgery instead
on my way over.

425
00:30:02,842 --> 00:30:05,345
So I won't apologize for being late today.

426
00:30:05,428 --> 00:30:06,638
And that's why

427
00:30:07,263 --> 00:30:09,140
I'm shutting the Trauma Unit down!

428
00:30:09,224 --> 00:30:10,517
You can't come here and do that!

429
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,477
You think you're better than us?
Is that it?

430
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,312
You think this hospital is a joke?

431
00:30:15,104 --> 00:30:17,607
Don't get the wrong idea
about our staff, Minister.

432
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:20,026
Baek Kang-hyuk!

433
00:30:20,109 --> 00:30:23,404
This Trauma Unit
is nothing but a liability.

434
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:24,948
That's why it's getting shut down

435
00:30:25,031 --> 00:30:29,244
and upgraded
into a full-blown Trauma Center.

436
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:35,166
A center?

437
00:30:36,376 --> 00:30:38,878
You think you can just do
whatever you want?

438
00:30:38,962 --> 00:30:41,381
- This is absolutely ridiculous!
- Unbelievable!

439
00:30:42,006 --> 00:30:44,217
Minister, I have your support?

440
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:46,469
Yes. Every step of the way.

441
00:30:48,054 --> 00:30:50,974
I'll make sure your investment
of ten billion won isn't wasted.

442
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:59,399
I will show you all
that I am, in fact, the real deal.

443
00:30:59,482 --> 00:31:02,944
That's all I have to say for now.
I am… finished.

444
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:05,029
Wait. Who do you think you are?

445
00:31:05,113 --> 00:31:07,282
- Dr. Baek. Dr. Baek.
- Hey, come back here!

446
00:31:07,365 --> 00:31:08,241
Hey!

447
00:31:08,324 --> 00:31:09,951
You haven't apologized!

448
00:31:10,034 --> 00:31:11,286
Where are you going?

449
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:13,538
Wait, Dr. Baek. Dr. Baek.

450
00:31:14,581 --> 00:31:16,833
Listen here.
You don't even belong in this room.

451
00:31:16,916 --> 00:31:20,003
If I may add something
to Dr. Baek's statement…

452
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:24,841
Dr. Baek may not be the most eloquent
or naturally gifted of speakers,

453
00:31:24,924 --> 00:31:27,510
but that doesn't mean that he's not right.

454
00:31:27,594 --> 00:31:30,179
I guarantee you he's the best of the best.

455
00:31:30,263 --> 00:31:32,557
Please give him a chance, for my sake.

456
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,100
Thank you very much.

457
00:31:34,183 --> 00:31:37,353
Oh, uh, Madam Minister? Uh…

458
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:40,356
Good talk.

459
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:49,532
As a nickname? Seriously?

460
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:54,621
Let's go. Come on.

461
00:31:55,204 --> 00:31:57,081
Dr. Baek called you "Anus" earlier.

462
00:31:57,165 --> 00:32:00,084
Hey, that was just hazing. You understand?

463
00:32:01,044 --> 00:32:03,379
That said, it seems like
Dr. Baek's taken a liking to you.

464
00:32:03,463 --> 00:32:05,465
Like he's taking you under his wing.

465
00:32:05,548 --> 00:32:07,967
What? Well, that's a truly scary thought.

466
00:32:08,051 --> 00:32:10,470
I mean,
who would leave colorectal surgery,

467
00:32:10,553 --> 00:32:13,431
the most prestigious field,
to apply for trauma surgery?

468
00:32:13,514 --> 00:32:15,141
Our hospital is a prime example.

469
00:32:15,224 --> 00:32:18,311
Yes, we do have a Trauma Unit,
but it's in name only.

470
00:32:18,394 --> 00:32:19,312
Yeah, right.

471
00:32:20,146 --> 00:32:23,608
Dr. Kwon Hak-su struggled all alone too.
I refuse to do that.

472
00:32:23,691 --> 00:32:26,569
Colorectal surgery is
a much less stressful field as well.

473
00:32:26,653 --> 00:32:28,988
There are rarely emergencies,
which is quite good.

474
00:32:29,072 --> 00:32:31,366
- The pay isn't bad too.
- You're right.

475
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:34,535
You're perfectly suited
to colorectal surgery.

476
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:36,037
That nickname's spot-on.

477
00:32:36,537 --> 00:32:37,830
Appreciate the coffee.

478
00:32:44,921 --> 00:32:47,548
Why is that so annoying but so right?

479
00:32:53,513 --> 00:32:55,181
EMERGENCY ROOM, HNUH

480
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:58,059
Yang Jae-won, general surgery.

481
00:33:03,481 --> 00:33:05,483
Ah, where is it?

482
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:20,581
{\an8}APPOINTMENT CEREMONY
ATTENDING TRAUMA SURGEON BAEK KANG-HYUK

483
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:22,583
Oh.

484
00:33:25,628 --> 00:33:27,255
Take that side down first!

485
00:33:28,089 --> 00:33:29,173
Where did he go?

486
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,224
Yes?

487
00:33:39,267 --> 00:33:41,102
There's a patient I need to see.

488
00:33:41,185 --> 00:33:42,854
Who are you?

489
00:33:42,937 --> 00:33:45,523
<i>Baek Kang-hyuk,</i>
<i>attending physician of trauma surgery.</i>

490
00:33:45,606 --> 00:33:47,692
Nobody by that name works here though.

491
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:51,487
<i>You can't just go around</i>
<i>impersonating doctors, sir.</i>

492
00:33:51,571 --> 00:33:52,780
Hey, come on now.

493
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:55,742
I really am a doctor here.

494
00:33:55,825 --> 00:33:58,745
<i>I did a thoracotomy in there</i>
<i>just this morning.</i>

495
00:33:58,828 --> 00:34:00,538
Don't be rude to me, all right?

496
00:34:00,621 --> 00:34:03,249
That's because I'm here
to see a patient right now.

497
00:34:03,332 --> 00:34:05,960
And don't raise your voice at me.
There are patients in here.

498
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:08,129
- Yes, I know.
<i>- What is the name of your patient?</i>

499
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:10,381
I didn't look at
the patient's name though.

500
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:11,841
Oh…

501
00:34:12,759 --> 00:34:15,636
I have the name of the doctor
who took the patient in.

502
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:17,555
And his name is…

503
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:19,182
It's…

504
00:34:20,183 --> 00:34:21,184
Anus?

505
00:34:25,188 --> 00:34:26,814
What's wrong with this asshole?

506
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:28,649
Hey, come on. Come on!

507
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:30,234
Come on!

508
00:34:30,777 --> 00:34:33,112
Son of a bitch. This girl is…

509
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:35,406
Hey. Anus.

510
00:34:37,867 --> 00:34:38,993
Going somewhere?

511
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:41,954
Baek, I was…

512
00:34:42,038 --> 00:34:43,956
Baek? So I'm Baek to you now?

513
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:44,874
Oh no!

514
00:34:45,541 --> 00:34:47,460
Forgive me. I've been looking for you.

515
00:34:48,169 --> 00:34:50,088
Really? Why?

516
00:34:51,464 --> 00:34:52,465
Bukhansan.

517
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:57,345
A patient fell off the hiking trail
at Bukhansan.

518
00:34:58,012 --> 00:34:59,514
It's serious trauma.

519
00:35:01,182 --> 00:35:02,850
<i>But their injuries are so severe</i>

520
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:05,770
<i>they're not sure</i>
<i>they'll survive transportation.</i>

521
00:35:07,313 --> 00:35:09,148
And the helicopter transport?

522
00:35:09,232 --> 00:35:12,777
Well, National Rescue Unit says
they'll bring them here.

523
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:15,321
Tell the helicopter to stop by here first.

524
00:35:15,404 --> 00:35:17,615
We'll go, and we'll treat them ourselves.

525
00:35:17,698 --> 00:35:19,575
Okay.

526
00:35:21,035 --> 00:35:22,286
We will?

527
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:23,538
That gonna be an issue?

528
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:25,289
You said "we"?

529
00:35:26,999 --> 00:35:28,126
Me and you.

530
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:31,170
But for now…

531
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:36,926
Call me when the helicopter's ready, yeah?
Get the trauma kit.

532
00:35:37,009 --> 00:35:38,719
I'm gonna check on my patient.

533
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:40,721
Wait a minute! Hold on! I… I…

534
00:35:47,687 --> 00:35:49,981
We're going in… a helicopter?

535
00:35:51,732 --> 00:35:52,859
The two of us?

536
00:35:57,405 --> 00:35:59,282
Right. Emergency ICU.

537
00:36:02,743 --> 00:36:04,662
Internal?

538
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:09,292
So the emergency ICU is the backup
for the main floor ICU?

539
00:36:12,628 --> 00:36:13,671
Huh.

540
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:20,678
Who are you?

541
00:36:20,761 --> 00:36:21,971
How did you get in here?

542
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:25,308
I recognize your voice.

543
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:28,394
Oh! That was you on the phone.

544
00:36:28,477 --> 00:36:30,188
What's that? Let's go.

545
00:36:30,271 --> 00:36:32,690
This is for medical professionals only.
Get out!

546
00:36:32,773 --> 00:36:34,525
I work here, you understand?

547
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:35,735
Ugh, whatever.

548
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:39,071
- And who are you?
- You wanna know my name now?

549
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:42,366
{\an8}Cheon Jang-mi.

550
00:36:43,576 --> 00:36:44,994
That's it. Now get out.

551
00:36:45,077 --> 00:36:46,370
- Leave.
- Hey.

552
00:36:46,996 --> 00:36:48,206
Come on now. Go!

553
00:36:48,289 --> 00:36:49,749
- Hey!
- Out. Get out.

554
00:36:49,832 --> 00:36:53,169
- Not that way. This way. Let's go now!
- Wait. You don't understand!

555
00:36:53,252 --> 00:36:54,545
Just give me a moment!

556
00:36:55,755 --> 00:36:56,756
Huh?

557
00:36:58,007 --> 00:36:58,925
<i>A tattoo?</i>

558
00:37:01,469 --> 00:37:02,845
<i>He has them too.</i>

559
00:37:05,681 --> 00:37:08,559
I'm telling you,
I dealt with that patient earlier.

560
00:37:09,518 --> 00:37:10,603
"Dealt with"?

561
00:38:00,319 --> 00:38:01,821
{\an8}MEDICAL OXYGEN

562
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:25,594
Oh…

563
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:28,597
Oh… No, no, no, no.

564
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:32,643
- Let go of me! Let go. Let go!
- How are you so strong?

565
00:38:32,727 --> 00:38:34,854
- Hey! Stop resisting!
- Are you a superhero?

566
00:38:34,937 --> 00:38:37,189
Damn! This girl!

567
00:38:38,774 --> 00:38:40,401
Just stay still for a second!

568
00:38:40,484 --> 00:38:42,695
- Stop that!
- Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

569
00:38:42,778 --> 00:38:44,322
- I'm outta here!
- Call the police! Go!

570
00:38:44,405 --> 00:38:45,448
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

571
00:38:45,531 --> 00:38:48,576
- Call the police! Report him!
- It's not what it looks like.

572
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:52,663
- This damn woman. Jesus Christ! Stop it!
- Whoa! Just calm down.

573
00:38:53,456 --> 00:38:54,749
Stay back!

574
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:57,752
Doctor, this man's in a gang!

575
00:39:05,301 --> 00:39:06,260
No, he's not.

576
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:08,804
- Huh?
- He's an attending.

577
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,976
He is. He's our new attending.

578
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:15,686
This is Dr. Baek Kang-hyuk.

579
00:39:19,482 --> 00:39:20,566
Oh, oh…

580
00:39:22,401 --> 00:39:24,403
- I apologize.
- In a gang?

581
00:39:26,322 --> 00:39:28,449
I think you're more likely
to be the gangster.

582
00:39:28,532 --> 00:39:31,285
It's just you said
you "dealt with" the patient earlier.

583
00:39:35,164 --> 00:39:36,665
Apologies.

584
00:39:37,583 --> 00:39:39,877
All right, Nurse Cheon Jang-mi.

585
00:39:43,589 --> 00:39:44,840
I know what to call you.

586
00:39:46,509 --> 00:39:47,843
Your nickname's Gangster

587
00:39:48,469 --> 00:39:49,428
from now on.

588
00:39:49,512 --> 00:39:50,346
Huh?

589
00:39:57,895 --> 00:40:00,564
{\an8}<i>Dr. Han Yu-Rim,</i>
<i>please report to…</i>

590
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:03,526
{\an8}I thought that death was
my only way out of the gang.

591
00:40:04,985 --> 00:40:06,987
{\an8}Thanks to your help, Doctor.

592
00:40:08,489 --> 00:40:10,741
{\an8}You even saved someone like me.

593
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:16,330
The kind of life you lead
or the kind of work you're involved with

594
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:17,915
is not what's important.

595
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:22,169
As a doctor, I have a duty to my patients.

596
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:26,132
Actually,

597
00:40:26,757 --> 00:40:30,010
it was a really good thing
that I was the one operating on you.

598
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:33,556
Other doctors couldn't have done it.
I'm saying you were really lucky.

599
00:40:36,642 --> 00:40:40,229
If some quack had operated,
you might have died today.

600
00:40:40,312 --> 00:40:44,066
And I heard it's really hot
down there these days.

601
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:46,944
Ah!And this doctor here.

602
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:51,073
This doctor played a vital role today
in keeping you alive.

603
00:40:51,824 --> 00:40:54,368
He stitched up
a part of your stomach earlier.

604
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:57,496
And I bet that you won't even
notice the scar there.

605
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:59,165
This man has the touch of God.

606
00:40:59,248 --> 00:41:01,792
Are you… Are you talking
about me, Doctor? Really?

607
00:41:02,501 --> 00:41:03,627
Thank you so much.

608
00:41:05,421 --> 00:41:06,297
AN JUNG-HEON

609
00:41:06,797 --> 00:41:08,424
Is the helicopter ready?

610
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:12,386
Yes, of course. Right away.
Yes. It's here. The helicopter.

611
00:41:13,179 --> 00:41:14,763
All right. Best of luck.

612
00:41:17,099 --> 00:41:18,392
Right. Nurse Jang-mi.

613
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:21,770
Hey, Gangster, check the patient's vitals
every 30 minutes.

614
00:41:21,854 --> 00:41:23,105
Ah. Yes, of course.

615
00:41:23,189 --> 00:41:24,607
- Run, Anus.
- Yes, sir.

616
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:28,027
"Anus"?

617
00:41:31,363 --> 00:41:33,032
You're a gangster?

618
00:41:35,117 --> 00:41:36,577
Ah…

619
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:38,496
It's just a dumb nickname.

620
00:41:45,836 --> 00:41:48,672
Whoa! Whoa! Just wait! Dr. Baek!

621
00:41:49,423 --> 00:41:50,466
What?

622
00:41:50,549 --> 00:41:52,384
That's the wrong way!
The heliport's that way!

623
00:41:52,468 --> 00:41:54,970
- Where is it, then?
- It's outside, over that way!

624
00:41:55,054 --> 00:41:57,097
Ah shit! Why didn't you say that?

625
00:42:36,637 --> 00:42:38,013
Wait? This is where it lands?

626
00:42:38,097 --> 00:42:40,599
That's right.
Dr. Baek, have a safe trip now.

627
00:42:41,225 --> 00:42:43,561
- Not on your back!
- What?

628
00:42:43,644 --> 00:42:46,063
- Gotta wear it on your front, okay?
- On my front?

629
00:42:46,146 --> 00:42:49,275
- Or the propellers will catch you!
- No, I can't. No, seriously!

630
00:42:57,283 --> 00:42:58,659
Come on! Let's go!

631
00:42:58,742 --> 00:43:00,953
Oh God! Wow.
This is really happening.

632
00:43:01,036 --> 00:43:03,122
Jesus!Ah! Oh no!

633
00:43:03,205 --> 00:43:05,708
{\an8}NATIONAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY
119 RESCUE UNIT

634
00:43:06,542 --> 00:43:08,002
Oh God! Help me!

635
00:43:34,528 --> 00:43:36,697
Official orders were given
about a year ago,

636
00:43:37,364 --> 00:43:39,950
but I admit that I've never flown
with doctors before.

637
00:43:40,034 --> 00:43:42,703
Well, this will be a frequent occurrence
from now on.

638
00:43:42,786 --> 00:43:43,746
Your name is?

639
00:43:43,829 --> 00:43:46,457
My name is An Jung-heon,
and I'm the team leader.

640
00:43:47,291 --> 00:43:48,959
Have you flown in helicopters?

641
00:43:49,043 --> 00:43:50,544
You don't seem nervous at all.

642
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:53,255
Yeah, this is pretty standard.

643
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:57,134
Well, I'd say… that's standard.

644
00:44:01,221 --> 00:44:03,974
Hey, Anus.
You gonna be able to work like that?

645
00:44:04,058 --> 00:44:05,934
Well, I have a fear of heights.

646
00:44:07,686 --> 00:44:09,271
You've got a ways to go, then.

647
00:44:18,822 --> 00:44:22,409
The weather is overcast.
Low visibility. It's pretty windy too.

648
00:44:22,493 --> 00:44:25,204
Captain, I don't think
we can get any closer.

649
00:44:30,709 --> 00:44:32,211
Situation on the ground?

650
00:44:32,878 --> 00:44:34,880
Patient is currently
in a critical condition.

651
00:44:34,963 --> 00:44:38,300
He's unconscious.
He has a very weak pulse.

652
00:44:38,384 --> 00:44:39,760
There's damage to his ribs.

653
00:44:39,843 --> 00:44:42,721
There might've been an impact to
the right side of his chest from the fall.

654
00:44:42,805 --> 00:44:45,933
- How much longer can you hold out?
<i>- He needs treatment immediately.</i>

655
00:44:46,433 --> 00:44:48,102
<i>You're bringing doctors, right?</i>

656
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:51,105
<i>We can't even transport him</i>
<i>in his current state.</i>

657
00:44:51,605 --> 00:44:54,775
<i>We'll lose the patient if</i>
<i>he's not treated by a doctor right away.</i>

658
00:44:56,318 --> 00:44:57,945
All right, listen. We need to hurry up.

659
00:45:00,155 --> 00:45:02,658
Too windy.
It's preventing us from getting closer.

660
00:45:02,741 --> 00:45:03,701
What?

661
00:45:04,368 --> 00:45:07,079
We can't hold this position.
We need to retreat.

662
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,961
Guess we've run out of options.

663
00:45:14,461 --> 00:45:15,337
Uh… Huh?

664
00:45:15,421 --> 00:45:16,547
- What's--
- Hold on tight.

665
00:45:16,630 --> 00:45:18,465
Oh, uh, Dr. Baek?

666
00:45:20,968 --> 00:45:22,010
What the hell?

667
00:45:22,761 --> 00:45:24,763
- No closer?
- What are you doing?

668
00:45:24,847 --> 00:45:26,265
Go back to your seat.

669
00:45:26,348 --> 00:45:27,516
I think we can make it.

670
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:29,518
Do something about this, Mr. An.

671
00:45:35,315 --> 00:45:38,569
- Can't we just carry him down ourselves?
- Way too risky.

672
00:45:47,536 --> 00:45:48,620
Oh!

673
00:46:40,839 --> 00:46:43,675
Listen. How about you and I switch now?

674
00:46:44,551 --> 00:46:45,385
Right.

675
00:46:53,185 --> 00:46:55,979
We're here.
Put the bag on and get ready.

676
00:46:56,063 --> 00:46:57,314
We're here? We're here?

677
00:47:04,321 --> 00:47:08,033
Oh! Oh! Oh no!

678
00:47:08,116 --> 00:47:10,244
Shut the door. Shut it!
Stop it! Stop it! Please!

679
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:19,461
Get a move on!

680
00:47:19,545 --> 00:47:22,339
No way! There's no way I can do this.
I'll just stay here.

681
00:47:22,422 --> 00:47:24,842
Really! I just can't. I can't. I can't.

682
00:47:24,925 --> 00:47:27,761
- No way. I can't. This is crazy!
- What if your family was down there?

683
00:47:47,114 --> 00:47:48,991
You're not thinking of jumping down,
are you?
