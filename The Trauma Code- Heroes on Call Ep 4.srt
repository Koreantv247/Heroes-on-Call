1
00:00:22,147 --> 00:00:23,273
Yes, this is Yang Jae-won.

2
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:48,089
Spinal needle.

3
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:49,382
One, two.

4
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:54,220
Wait a minute! Excuse me! I'm sorry!

5
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:55,930
Try one gram of IV acetaminophen.

6
00:01:04,522 --> 00:01:05,940
Warm saline. Warm saline!

7
00:01:06,024 --> 00:01:06,941
Gauze.

8
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:11,571
Press down hard!

9
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:16,761
THE TRAUMA CODE: HEROES ON CALL

10
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:49,169
JI-YEONG

11
00:02:49,252 --> 00:02:51,129
Oh, really? "Ji-yeong"?

12
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:53,548
I guess he has time to date.

13
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:56,134
I'm gonna work him harder.

14
00:02:57,427 --> 00:02:59,846
Uh, uh…

15
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,307
Hey. Do you know a Choi Jo-eun?

16
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:04,017
The name sounds really familiar.

17
00:03:05,226 --> 00:03:07,604
That's the Hospital Director. Choi Jo-eun.

18
00:03:08,104 --> 00:03:09,147
Director?

19
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:10,732
Ah!

20
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:12,567
It's no wonder.

21
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:17,113
He's been calling me
to attend this meeting.

22
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:20,617
Oh, oh, oh!

23
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:21,951
EMAIL: HNUH BUDGET MEETING

24
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:23,536
Oh, then you have to go.

25
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,622
Yeah? Why?

26
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:27,373
I get that it's temporary.

27
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:29,375
However, you're still
the head of trauma surgery.

28
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:31,127
Hmm? Mm.

29
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:34,881
That said, don't go getting your hopes up.

30
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:36,549
And don't even…

31
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,885
It's your first time,

32
00:03:38,968 --> 00:03:41,471
so you probably won't
get a say in anything.

33
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:43,556
Hmm. Here's the thing.

34
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,226
I'm actually an expert
at crashing things like this.

35
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:50,480
Ah! You got a call from Ji-yeong.

36
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:56,653
HANKUK NATIONAL UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL
BUDGET MEETING

37
00:03:56,736 --> 00:04:01,366
The next doctor invited to enter is head
of general surgery and colorectal surgery.

38
00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:03,368
Han Yu-rim. Where is he?

39
00:04:03,451 --> 00:04:04,494
Yes sir!

40
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:08,414
Right here.

41
00:04:16,714 --> 00:04:18,007
- Hello.
- Hello.

42
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:19,592
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

43
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:20,927
Good morning.

44
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:22,679
- Hello, sir.
- Good morning.

45
00:04:24,013 --> 00:04:25,014
You may enter.

46
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:27,684
- One, two. Mic test.
- Jae-hun!

47
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:32,647
Hello, Dr. Han.

48
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:34,482
You forget that we're
in a formal setting now.

49
00:04:34,565 --> 00:04:37,568
Ah. My apologies, Director Hong.

50
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:39,737
That's better.

51
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:44,826
So I hear that you've
discovered something.

52
00:04:44,909 --> 00:04:46,744
I did.

53
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:49,414
Baek Kang-hyuk's history
is quite fascinating.

54
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:53,501
And today, we're going to bury him alive.

55
00:04:58,089 --> 00:04:58,923
Ha!

56
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:02,760
Head of Biomedical Engineering,
Dr. An Jeong-hyeon.

57
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:07,307
Head of Hematology Oncology,
Dr. Shin Hyeon-jeong.

58
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,641
Yes. You may enter now.

59
00:05:09,183 --> 00:05:11,978
Hold it. Please wait
for your name to be called.

60
00:05:12,061 --> 00:05:14,230
Why can't we all just go inside right now?

61
00:05:14,897 --> 00:05:16,399
It's standard procedure.

62
00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:18,067
Yes, you may go in.

63
00:05:20,236 --> 00:05:23,489
Next is the Head of Nuclear Medicine,
Dr. Jung Hyeon-mi.

64
00:05:24,073 --> 00:05:25,491
Yes. You may enter.

65
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:30,621
Next up is Dr. Lee Gi-beom
of Allergy Medicine.

66
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:34,083
"Standard procedure."
Who gives a shit?

67
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:37,378
Heads of subspecialty departments
are not taken seriously.

68
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:39,839
You'll be lucky
if they even let you speak at all.

69
00:05:39,922 --> 00:05:42,633
Plus, they're probably gonna
cut our budget anyway, you know?

70
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:46,012
And heads of sub-specialties,
you may now proceed inside.

71
00:05:51,267 --> 00:05:53,102
Christ. How many are there?

72
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:54,687
A lot!

73
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:57,148
And, you know,
we're not the only specialty

74
00:05:57,231 --> 00:05:59,442
that wants some of
the trauma center's funding.

75
00:06:09,577 --> 00:06:12,455
<i>Any department that sees</i>
<i>even one trauma patient a year</i>

76
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:13,998
<i>will want a piece of the pie.</i>

77
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:17,460
<i>That's why I'm saying</i>
<i>they're most likely to use the funding</i>

78
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:19,212
<i>to purchase shared equipment.</i>

79
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:22,799
<i>Which means</i>

80
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:26,594
<i>that you're walking into a war zone</i>
<i>with no allies.</i>

81
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,723
{\an8}"ACTING" HEAD OF TRAUMA SURGERY
BAEK KANG-HYUK

82
00:06:33,684 --> 00:06:35,686
The hospital director has arrived.

83
00:06:37,021 --> 00:06:38,689
- Mm. Mm.
- Sir.

84
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:47,615
Right.
Let's begin the meeting right away.

85
00:06:48,282 --> 00:06:49,367
Director Hong?

86
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:53,579
{\an8}This year, Hankuk National
University Hospital has finally reached

87
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:56,374
the ultimate milestone
of 30 billion won in profit.

88
00:07:01,712 --> 00:07:03,965
Yes, you've all done very well.

89
00:07:04,048 --> 00:07:06,843
And the undisputed top earner is, uh…

90
00:07:07,468 --> 00:07:09,554
Ah, this is exciting.

91
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:11,139
For the second year in a row,

92
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:13,307
the funeral hall.

93
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:16,978
Uh, the funeral hall is unbeatable, huh?

94
00:07:17,061 --> 00:07:20,356
In second place, the parking garage.
Third place is the cafeteria.

95
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:23,234
In fourth place…

96
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:27,196
In fourth place is…

97
00:07:29,198 --> 00:07:30,158
Neurosurgery.

98
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:34,495
Congratulations!

99
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:37,790
Dr. No has been recognized as
a leading expert in gamma knife surgery,

100
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:39,834
which has led to a spike in revenue.

101
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:43,463
It's almost on par with the cafeteria.
Look at that.

102
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:44,714
Just a moment.

103
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:47,717
Dr. No.

104
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:52,346
You have done very well.
Another round of applause!

105
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:54,974
Amazing!

106
00:08:01,772 --> 00:08:06,068
If departments had to fistfight
for money, Dr. Baek would win out.

107
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:07,111
It's so sad.

108
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:09,197
Ah, yeah, that is unfortunate.

109
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:11,365
Oh, by the way.

110
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:14,368
You remember the day
that Dr. Baek took us out for dinner?

111
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:15,328
Yes.

112
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:17,205
I arrived at the restaurant
before you two.

113
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:19,081
- Yes.
- Do you know who I saw?

114
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:22,376
Who?

115
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:24,545
I remember

116
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:26,631
following the waitress.

117
00:08:26,714 --> 00:08:29,383
As I'm walking, I look over and see…

118
00:08:32,386 --> 00:08:33,804
Good evening.

119
00:08:35,973 --> 00:08:36,807
Good evening.

120
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,476
Whoa.

121
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:41,312
- Huh?
- Hi.

122
00:08:41,395 --> 00:08:42,647
I reserved a room for us.

123
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,113
Was it adultery?

124
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:52,073
What?

125
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:54,951
Well, I've always known him
as a single father.

126
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:57,870
No! I'm telling you, they didn't have
married-couple chemistry.

127
00:08:58,454 --> 00:09:01,624
He was on his best behavior.
He even held the door open for her.

128
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:04,877
No, I don't think so.

129
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:07,505
- Uh, well, then what?
- I…

130
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:10,007
Just a minute.

131
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:13,511
This is Yang Jae-won speaking.

132
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:16,556
Traffic accident?

133
00:09:18,015 --> 00:09:19,517
{\an8}It's in-car? Thanks. Bye.

134
00:09:20,184 --> 00:09:23,479
{\an8}At least it's in-car. There should be
less damage than a pedestrian accident.

135
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:25,773
Let's get the resuscitation room
prepared for now.

136
00:09:25,856 --> 00:09:27,567
Oh, aren't you going to message Dr. Baek?

137
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:32,238
Uh… We should assess the patient first.

138
00:09:32,321 --> 00:09:34,323
- He's still in the meeting.
- That's true.

139
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:37,368
Please turn your attention
to this chart.

140
00:09:37,451 --> 00:09:41,789
We'll be discussing the deficit situation
at Hankuk National University Hospital.

141
00:09:41,872 --> 00:09:43,457
HNUH PROFIT STANDINGS
THORACIC SURGERY

142
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:44,750
Cardiac surgery.

143
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:47,420
It's around 342 million won at this point.

144
00:09:48,212 --> 00:09:49,338
Who's in charge there?

145
00:09:51,173 --> 00:09:53,467
Ah. Well, you have done better
compared to last year.

146
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:54,969
Yes, that's right, sir.

147
00:09:55,052 --> 00:09:58,431
Obstetrics and gynecology have also
improved at under 100 million won.

148
00:09:58,514 --> 00:10:01,142
Mm. Dr. An, going forward,

149
00:10:01,225 --> 00:10:05,271
let's just work a little harder
to get into the black, huh? You can do it.

150
00:10:05,354 --> 00:10:06,522
Oh, I will!

151
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:09,400
Let's see.
Urology and rehabilitation medicine.

152
00:10:09,483 --> 00:10:12,320
The other departments
aren't particularly noteworthy.

153
00:10:15,072 --> 00:10:16,574
Now trauma surgery.

154
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,202
Bear in mind
that the figures for trauma surgery

155
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:22,788
are from the last month only.

156
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:25,374
Trauma surgery.

157
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:29,962
A 412.52 million won deficit!

158
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:33,674
My goodness. That's crazy!

159
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:52,693
Well, Dr. Baek.

160
00:10:53,235 --> 00:10:55,488
That is a pretty large number? Yeah?

161
00:10:55,571 --> 00:10:59,492
Apologies. However, your, uh,
calculations are a little off.

162
00:10:59,575 --> 00:11:02,536
You should include the ten billion
that the trauma center received.

163
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:05,039
And that puts us
well into the black, right?

164
00:11:05,122 --> 00:11:08,209
That funding is for
the hospital as a whole,

165
00:11:08,292 --> 00:11:10,086
not just your department, understand?

166
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:12,296
Because anesthesiology,
emergency medicine,

167
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:16,008
and any other relevant department
may be involved in treating your patients.

168
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:18,469
Well, in that case, that would mean

169
00:11:18,552 --> 00:11:21,180
that the loss should be attributed to
the entire hospital,

170
00:11:21,263 --> 00:11:23,099
not just our department, don't you think?

171
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:24,850
Come on. That's a separate issue.

172
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:26,602
That's not what we're discussing.

173
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:28,688
This figure here is what's relevant.

174
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:33,025
Ah! You're saying you want
to share this money,

175
00:11:33,609 --> 00:11:36,529
and yet you want our department
to take care of the mess?

176
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:37,738
What did you just say?

177
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:42,076
My fellow doctors, come on.
We're all here to save lives, aren't we?

178
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:43,411
Aren't we?

179
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:50,000
Settle down now. This is serious.

180
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:53,129
Show some decorum, Doctor. Huh?

181
00:11:54,588 --> 00:11:55,673
Baek Kang-hyuk.

182
00:11:57,341 --> 00:12:00,469
We acknowledge all the hard work
you've done saving trauma patients--

183
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:03,806
Yes, well, I appreciate
your acknowledgment.

184
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:06,100
If you look at recent statistics,

185
00:12:06,183 --> 00:12:08,686
you'll find that the survival rate
of trauma patients

186
00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:11,355
has dramatically increased
ever since my arrival.

187
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:14,817
Uh, yes, yes, yes. Congratulations.

188
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,861
But congratulations aside,

189
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:19,989
we'd like to see a dramatic decrease
in your department's losses.

190
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:23,617
Over nine billion won of that funding
will be allocated to the equipment budget.

191
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:25,536
This decision is final.

192
00:12:25,619 --> 00:12:28,789
So you might as well
put that discussion to rest.

193
00:12:37,673 --> 00:12:38,841
What is this bastard thinking?

194
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:40,426
Uh, I apologize.

195
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:43,387
You really have a way
with words, Director.

196
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:45,389
'Cause that joke was hilarious.

197
00:12:47,683 --> 00:12:48,809
What does that mean?

198
00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:51,520
You… you weren't joking?

199
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:54,690
Well, then, that's one billion won
minus the deficit,

200
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:57,526
which leaves
around 500 million won and change.

201
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:59,862
And you're saying
that's all we can use until next year?

202
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:02,239
You must be completely off your rocker.

203
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:03,699
That makes no sense.

204
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:05,618
Baek Kang-hyuk!

205
00:13:06,368 --> 00:13:08,579
You are really pushing it, I swear to God!

206
00:13:08,662 --> 00:13:11,999
Director Choi is being very gracious,
and this is how you respond?

207
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:14,710
You son of a bitch.
You'd better apologize!

208
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:15,920
What?

209
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:17,087
You talking to me?

210
00:13:18,005 --> 00:13:20,257
- You really want me to lay into you too?
- Go ahead. Try me.

211
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:22,384
Try me! Do it, asshole! Let's go!

212
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:25,137
After I'm through with you today,
you won't be able to show your face.

213
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:37,066
Traffic accident. No pulse.

214
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:39,568
- When did she lose consciousness?
- Two minutes since flatline.

215
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:42,571
I'll assess the patient first.
Just wait a second.

216
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:44,824
Is her next of kin on their way?

217
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:46,534
We can't get in touch with them.

218
00:13:48,786 --> 00:13:49,745
Ji-yeong.

219
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:57,503
<i>Dr. Jae-won.</i>

220
00:13:57,586 --> 00:14:00,673
<i>I've been accepted to the medical school</i>
<i>at Hankuk National University.</i>

221
00:14:00,756 --> 00:14:01,715
<i>Really?</i>

222
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:04,593
Well, congratulations.

223
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:05,803
Just like your father.

224
00:14:06,303 --> 00:14:08,556
Actually,
I'm following in your footsteps.

225
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,766
Guess that makes you my senior now, right?

226
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:16,438
Let's transfer her
to a bed first.

227
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:26,824
Dr. Yang.

228
00:14:26,907 --> 00:14:29,076
Right now,
the patient's pulse is undetectable!

229
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:31,996
Ji-yeong! Ji-yeong!

230
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:33,539
One, two, three!

231
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:35,916
- We need to call Dr. Baek right now!
- Okay!

232
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,251
- Hurry up!
- Quickly.

233
00:14:37,334 --> 00:14:39,295
Okay, let's hurry.
This way. Hurry.

234
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:42,631
You act all high-and-mighty
'cause you've saved a few patients.

235
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:44,717
You think that gives you the right
to look down on me

236
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,136
because I'm just a colorectal surgeon.

237
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:48,470
Fine. Go ahead.

238
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:51,682
We all know who the real money-grubber is,
you hypocritical jerk!

239
00:14:51,765 --> 00:14:53,559
I'm totally confused right now.

240
00:14:53,642 --> 00:14:55,978
Right. You wouldn't know.
But I've heard things.

241
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:59,607
Fellow doctors, Baek Kang-hyuk
has been hiding something from us,

242
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:02,651
and when I'm done with revealing
your true nature today, you'll…

243
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:03,944
- Don't take that!
- Yeah, what?

244
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:05,487
Are you serious?

245
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:07,364
- How dare you take a call!
- Yes, go ahead.

246
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:10,159
I got a call too, but I'll ignore it!

247
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:12,995
I rejected my call,
so hurry up and end your call!

248
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:15,205
We're not done! This bastard is…

249
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:16,957
What is this?

250
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:18,542
- <i>Dr. Han.</i>
- What is this about?

251
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:21,128
<i>Your daughter is Han Ji-yeong, right?</i>
<i>She is in the ER right now.</i>

252
00:15:21,211 --> 00:15:23,881
<i>- She was in a traffic accident.</i>
- Wait a minute. What are you saying?

253
00:15:23,964 --> 00:15:27,134
<i>- Your daughter was in a traffic accident.</i>
- Are you sure it's really her?

254
00:15:27,217 --> 00:15:29,929
<i>- You're with Dr. Baek, right?</i>
- Wait. Say that again.

255
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:32,890
<i>- We're doing CPR. Get here right now.</i>
- What?

256
00:15:32,973 --> 00:15:33,933
<i>Hurry!</i>

257
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:35,601
CPR? You're saying…

258
00:15:35,684 --> 00:15:38,687
How bad is it that she needs CPR?
All right, I'm coming!

259
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:39,647
Hold on.

260
00:15:40,147 --> 00:15:41,106
Goodbye!

261
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:44,234
Baek Kang-hyuk! Baek Kang-hyuk!

262
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:45,444
Baek Kang-hyuk!

263
00:15:46,153 --> 00:15:47,821
Baek. Baek Kang… Baek…

264
00:15:48,572 --> 00:15:51,700
Dr. Baek! Wait a second!
I didn't really mean that--

265
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:54,578
- Would you get out of the way?
- No, wait, wait! You can't go.

266
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:56,246
Save my daughter first!

267
00:15:56,872 --> 00:15:58,832
She was in a traffic accident.

268
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:02,628
They're performing CPR,
but they really need your help right now.

269
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:05,214
I'll die if anything happens to her.

270
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:07,633
She's my only daughter.
I raised her on my own.

271
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:10,052
Pl… please, will you?

272
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:12,596
Can you just save my Ji-yeong first?

273
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:13,514
Hmm?

274
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:17,977
I'm going to save your daughter right now.

275
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:22,982
You are the one keeping me from her.
It could already be too late.

276
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:34,493
Ji-yeong.

277
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:36,161
Ji-yeong!

278
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:37,997
Ji-yeong!

279
00:16:39,623 --> 00:16:42,960
- Epinephrine. Epinephrine. Right now!
- Okay. All right.

280
00:16:43,752 --> 00:16:45,087
Epinephrine is in.

281
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:54,346
Ji-yeong!

282
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:56,473
Her father's gonna be here any second!

283
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:58,726
- Hold on! Ji-yeong!
- Dr. Han! Dr. Han!

284
00:16:58,809 --> 00:17:00,728
- Dr. Baek!
- Ji-yeong! Let go!

285
00:17:00,811 --> 00:17:03,147
Number One, I need you level-headed.
Do you understand?

286
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:04,565
- Yes!
- What is this?

287
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:06,358
- Get the defibrillator ready.
- Yes!

288
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:08,027
- Ji-yeong! Ji-yeong!
- Hold on!

289
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:10,487
Move! Get out of my way! Move, damn it!

290
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:11,864
- Don't let him in.
- Yes, sir.

291
00:17:11,947 --> 00:17:14,783
Step back! Get off! I'm fine! Let go!

292
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:16,326
Look at me. Look at me.

293
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:18,162
- Calm down, Doctor.
- Get off!

294
00:17:18,245 --> 00:17:21,165
- You can't see her now! You can't go in!
- Hell, I can't! Who says I can't?

295
00:17:21,248 --> 00:17:23,917
- That's my daughter!
- That's exactly why you can't go in there!

296
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:26,962
Let go!

297
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:36,055
Ji-yeong. Ji-yeong.

298
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,433
Just tell me. Is it bad?

299
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:41,935
It is.

300
00:17:44,938 --> 00:17:47,357
Oh no…

301
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:49,234
Oh no…

302
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:52,279
This can't be.

303
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:55,657
Oh my God. Ji-yeong. Ji-yeong.

304
00:17:57,743 --> 00:17:59,453
Even if you were to go in,

305
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:01,288
you'd only get in the way.

306
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:04,583
We'll let you see her when things settle.

307
00:18:10,672 --> 00:18:11,632
Just wait…

308
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:13,467
Wait a minute.

309
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:16,011
But if it…

310
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:20,766
If it looks like things are…

311
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:23,644
are turning really bad,

312
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:26,939
just let me see her, then.

313
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:29,191
Promise me.

314
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,277
Please?

315
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:36,448
I'll do that.

316
00:18:43,914 --> 00:18:46,125
Catheter.
150 mg of amiodarone.

317
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:48,168
- Prepare intubation.
- Yes, sir!

318
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:52,714
V-fib.

319
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:54,007
- Get down.
- Right.

320
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,844
Charge to 200 joules.

321
00:18:58,971 --> 00:18:59,847
Charged to 200.

322
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:00,848
Clear.

323
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:01,974
Shock.

324
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:07,062
Still in V-fib.

325
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:08,188
Charge again.

326
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:09,148
Okay.

327
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:13,652
Charged.

328
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:17,239
Clear.

329
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:27,749
Shock.

330
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:11,168
What is it?

331
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:16,924
Is she alive?

332
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:18,217
Her heart rate's normal.

333
00:20:21,678 --> 00:20:22,888
Oh, thank you.

334
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:26,225
God, thank you. I thank you so much!

335
00:20:28,268 --> 00:20:29,978
We're gonna perform an echocardiogram.

336
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:31,730
Hold on! Hold on! Wait a minute.

337
00:20:32,272 --> 00:20:35,525
But a trauma surgeon
can't read an echocardiogram. Just wait.

338
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:38,654
I'll call a cardiologist.
So just wait a minute. Let me talk to him.

339
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:40,697
- Nurse Cheon?
- Hurry, go back now.

340
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:44,409
A trauma surgeon
can't read an echocardiogram.

341
00:20:46,536 --> 00:20:49,289
Number One.
What does that look like to you?

342
00:20:52,459 --> 00:20:54,169
Doctor, this…

343
00:20:54,795 --> 00:20:56,380
She needs surgery.

344
00:20:57,798 --> 00:20:59,132
Are you close with the patient?

345
00:21:04,888 --> 00:21:08,100
Sit out if you can't do this,
or you'll just be in the way.

346
00:21:12,562 --> 00:21:13,689
I'll be fine.

347
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:14,856
I will, Dr. Baek.

348
00:21:18,026 --> 00:21:19,861
- Anesthesiology.
- I'll call them.

349
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:24,366
DR. HAN YU-RIM

350
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:28,870
- Dr. Han?
<i>- Jesus, Jae-min.</i>

351
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:32,916
<i>What took you so long to answer the phone?</i>
<i>There's an emergency! Hurry here now!</i>

352
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:36,295
- What do you mean?
- You don't understand! It's Ji-yeong!

353
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:38,422
It's my daughter! She's in the ER!

354
00:21:38,505 --> 00:21:39,589
Ji-yeong is?

355
00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:42,634
Jae-min, please come
and read her echocardiogram. It's bad!

356
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:44,428
Hey, wait! Wait! Hey, hey! Ji-yeong!

357
00:21:44,511 --> 00:21:46,054
Ji-yeong. Where are you going?

358
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:48,223
- Where are you taking her?
- Go on. I'll be right there.

359
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:50,392
- Jae-won. Where are you going?
- Dr. Han!

360
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:52,978
Snap out of it! Settle down!

361
00:21:53,061 --> 00:21:55,105
Listen carefully.

362
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:59,401
Your daughter… suffered a heart rupture.

363
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:00,944
Heart rupture?

364
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:04,031
Over 90% of her left ventricular
lateral wall is torn.

365
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:07,284
Are you sure? What if you misread it?

366
00:22:07,367 --> 00:22:08,285
You're not listening.

367
00:22:08,368 --> 00:22:10,787
Her heart is ruptured,
which means she needs surgery now!

368
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:11,705
What if…

369
00:22:11,788 --> 00:22:14,416
Will you take responsibility
if something goes wrong?

370
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:17,294
Yes! I'll take responsibility for it!

371
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:22,341
Hey! Hey! Hey!

372
00:22:22,966 --> 00:22:24,593
Hey, hey, hey!

373
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:26,261
{\an8}<i>What the hell's going on?</i>

374
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:28,680
{\an8}<i>Dr. Han. Do whatever it takes to stop him.</i>

375
00:22:29,264 --> 00:22:31,266
Wait. You can't all be serious!

376
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:34,811
You're going into surgery right now?
What? And without my consent?

377
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:36,646
Standard for emergency surgeries.

378
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:38,857
Wait! Take another look
at the echocardiogram.

379
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:40,901
I've already seen it!
What's the point?

380
00:22:40,984 --> 00:22:42,694
I don't trust you!

381
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:44,279
What's that?

382
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:48,325
If you have a grudge against me,
then you're gonna take it out on her.

383
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:50,786
Hey, Number One.

384
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:53,455
Come here. Bring Gangster with you.

385
00:22:54,289 --> 00:22:55,374
Yes, sir.

386
00:22:55,457 --> 00:22:58,043
- Okay. Start the anesthesia!
- Okay.

387
00:22:58,126 --> 00:22:59,086
Yes?

388
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:01,671
This is
Han Ji-yeong's next of kin.

389
00:23:01,755 --> 00:23:02,631
I know.

390
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:04,716
Yes! Yes! I'm her next of kin.

391
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,677
So, everyone,
wait until cardiology arrives.

392
00:23:07,761 --> 00:23:10,389
He's asking us to wait
until her heart is about to burst.

393
00:23:10,472 --> 00:23:11,306
Does that seem sane?

394
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:14,226
Uh, now isn't really the time.

395
00:23:15,977 --> 00:23:17,687
If the next of kin lacks sound judgment

396
00:23:17,771 --> 00:23:20,482
due to being mentally incapacitated
or for similar reasons,

397
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:24,194
the consent of two doctors is deemed
adequate to proceed with surgery. Right?

398
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:27,406
- Yes, that's right.
- What kind of bullshit is that?

399
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:30,826
He's not in his right mind.
So give consent for him.

400
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:35,956
- I have consented.
- Son of a bitch! You better not--

401
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:37,749
- Just stop!
- You crazy bastard.

402
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:40,001
- What consent? Consent?
- Calm down.

403
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:42,712
- If you mess this up, you could kill her!
- BP dropping.

404
00:23:42,796 --> 00:23:44,631
- What if she dies?
- Dr. Baek!

405
00:23:44,714 --> 00:23:46,967
- You can't.
- We need to crack her chest now!

406
00:23:49,302 --> 00:23:51,471
- Just try to calm down for now.
- You can't.

407
00:23:51,555 --> 00:23:52,889
Don't worry, Dr. Han.

408
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:55,183
Jae-won. Don't do it! No! You can't!

409
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:57,519
At this rate,
Ji-yeong is gonna end up dead!

410
00:24:01,189 --> 00:24:02,983
I consent!

411
00:24:03,066 --> 00:24:05,694
Hey, how could you? How could you?

412
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:08,155
No, no! No!

413
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:09,823
Oh no! You can't.

414
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:13,493
{\an8}SURGERY IN PROGRESS

415
00:24:13,577 --> 00:24:16,246
Please. Look, please?
Just open the door, okay?

416
00:24:16,329 --> 00:24:17,247
Open the door.

417
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:19,040
- What do you think you're doing?
- Han Yu-rim!

418
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:21,042
Oh, Jesus Christ! Oh, Jae-min.

419
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:23,795
Help! Baek Kang-hyuk
has taken my daughter into an OR.

420
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:25,630
He hasn't started, right?
Let me in!

421
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:26,756
- Quick!
- Just step back!

422
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,967
- Get out of the way now!
- You can't come in.

423
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:30,385
I'm a cardiovascular specialist!

424
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:32,888
- I can't let you in!
- Please!

425
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:34,556
Let me in.

426
00:24:36,099 --> 00:24:37,184
Let me in.

427
00:24:39,227 --> 00:24:40,729
Just open the door.

428
00:24:45,775 --> 00:24:48,361
{\an8}NAME: HAN JI-YEONG, GENDER: FEMALE
HEART RUPTURE

429
00:24:57,787 --> 00:25:00,332
- He cracked her chest!
- Hey, just hold still.

430
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:03,043
Number One. Stay focused.

431
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:05,086
Cut.

432
00:25:06,588 --> 00:25:07,464
Scissors.

433
00:25:08,298 --> 00:25:09,925
God! Oh my God!

434
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:13,220
A rupture?

435
00:25:13,303 --> 00:25:14,554
It is?

436
00:25:14,638 --> 00:25:16,640
Gangster,
get them out of here.

437
00:25:16,723 --> 00:25:17,974
- Ji-yeong.
- Dr. Baek.

438
00:25:18,058 --> 00:25:19,726
There's too much bleeding.

439
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,564
Give me a glove.

440
00:25:24,648 --> 00:25:26,775
- Pardon?
- A surgical glove. Now!

441
00:25:30,987 --> 00:25:31,821
Hurry up!

442
00:25:32,989 --> 00:25:34,032
Block the bleed.

443
00:25:34,115 --> 00:25:35,158
With my hand?

444
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:36,868
- Block it!
- Yes, sir.

445
00:25:40,997 --> 00:25:42,624
- Dr. Han!
- Dr. Han!

446
00:25:42,707 --> 00:25:46,044
- Dr. Han! Dr. Han! Wake up!
- Dr. Baek. What do we do?

447
00:25:47,087 --> 00:25:48,380
Dr. Baek. Do something. Anything!

448
00:25:48,463 --> 00:25:50,632
Keep it blocked.
I'm gonna cover it up.

449
00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:54,427
The patient will die before we can get
the surgical field properly stitched up.

450
00:25:56,263 --> 00:25:57,347
You're using that?

451
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,143
How are you gonna use a glove…

452
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:03,603
Move your hand.

453
00:26:13,947 --> 00:26:15,198
Come on! Stitch it up.

454
00:26:15,782 --> 00:26:17,409
Okay. Placing sutures.

455
00:26:29,671 --> 00:26:31,006
Move out of the way!

456
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:34,676
Ji-yeong!

457
00:26:35,468 --> 00:26:36,303
Ji-yeong.

458
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:40,473
Where is she? Ji-yeong?

459
00:26:43,393 --> 00:26:46,271
Jesus. Closing a wound
with a surgical glove?

460
00:26:46,354 --> 00:26:47,897
You need to study more.

461
00:26:47,981 --> 00:26:50,525
You call yourself a trauma surgeon,
and you didn't know about that?

462
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:52,611
How would I know
if I've never learned it?

463
00:26:52,694 --> 00:26:54,487
This doesn't come out in textbooks.

464
00:26:54,571 --> 00:26:56,906
Hey. You think this is over?

465
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:00,160
Sorry, Doctor.

466
00:27:03,163 --> 00:27:04,164
Listen up.

467
00:27:06,416 --> 00:27:08,918
The surgical glove will only
buy us about ten minutes.

468
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:11,046
{\an8}We have ten minutes
to finish reinforcement.

469
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:12,797
{\an8}Everyone, stay focused.

470
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:14,299
{\an8}Suture.

471
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:24,309
First, we reset the pericardium
with wider margins than the glove.

472
00:27:25,393 --> 00:27:26,603
So we cover the glove

473
00:27:27,771 --> 00:27:29,022
and then suture it.

474
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:33,443
Uh, Dr. Baek, but

475
00:27:34,402 --> 00:27:37,530
do we leave the glove in place?
I know it's sterile, but would…

476
00:27:37,614 --> 00:27:38,865
Are you insane?

477
00:27:39,366 --> 00:27:40,700
Of course we'll remove it.

478
00:27:41,618 --> 00:27:42,952
Bring me an endoscope.

479
00:27:43,036 --> 00:27:44,746
An endoscope?

480
00:27:51,461 --> 00:27:54,714
The ones in the old building?
Used for nasal surgery?

481
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:56,925
You have five minutes. Run!

482
00:27:57,008 --> 00:27:57,884
Huh?

483
00:27:58,385 --> 00:28:01,429
Yes. That's the message
Dr. Baek wanted me to convey.

484
00:28:03,431 --> 00:28:04,557
Oh.

485
00:28:05,975 --> 00:28:09,896
A nasal endoscope used for heart surgery?
I've never heard of such a thing.

486
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:13,108
Uh, Dr. Han?

487
00:28:13,608 --> 00:28:16,361
Move, move! Wait, wait, wait! Where is it?

488
00:28:16,444 --> 00:28:17,737
Otolaryngology.

489
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:19,447
Wait. This… this way.

490
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:22,075
Oh, everyone's so stressed.

491
00:28:54,816 --> 00:28:58,361
Oh, I didn't know
that was even possible.

492
00:29:08,121 --> 00:29:10,582
- Okay. All done.
- Whoa.

493
00:29:10,665 --> 00:29:12,876
Dr. Park,
how's her blood pressure?

494
00:29:12,959 --> 00:29:14,794
120 over 80. It's perfect.

495
00:29:16,296 --> 00:29:17,756
Okay. Next.

496
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:18,882
Next?

497
00:29:20,216 --> 00:29:21,384
We close her up.

498
00:29:26,723 --> 00:29:28,600
Surgery is over.

499
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:30,769
How did it go?

500
00:29:31,936 --> 00:29:32,771
Ji…

501
00:29:32,854 --> 00:29:35,732
- Ji-yeong is alive. She's alive, Yu-rim.
- She's--

502
00:29:35,815 --> 00:29:36,900
She's alive?

503
00:29:38,026 --> 00:29:39,027
So she's…

504
00:29:39,986 --> 00:29:41,112
She's okay?

505
00:29:47,827 --> 00:29:51,998
Trauma surgeries like these
are the main cause of the budget deficit.

506
00:29:55,585 --> 00:29:57,003
Thank you.

507
00:29:59,547 --> 00:30:00,548
What did you say?

508
00:30:01,716 --> 00:30:03,927
I said, "Thank you!"

509
00:30:11,768 --> 00:30:14,771
So do you get it now?
Why we need this department?

510
00:30:15,438 --> 00:30:19,734
There's no predicting when an accident
like this will happen again.

511
00:30:21,444 --> 00:30:23,780
Severe trauma can happen to anyone.

512
00:30:27,742 --> 00:30:28,910
Dr. Baek.

513
00:30:28,993 --> 00:30:30,745
Dr. Baek, thank you.

514
00:30:31,996 --> 00:30:33,998
You saved my daughter's life.

515
00:30:43,925 --> 00:30:45,093
Wait, uh…

516
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:47,554
Open your eyes. Huh?

517
00:30:48,304 --> 00:30:49,681
It's Dad. It's your dad.

518
00:30:50,265 --> 00:30:51,307
Ji-yeong.

519
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:53,059
Hey, Anus.

520
00:30:53,142 --> 00:30:54,853
- Yes?
- Yes? Huh?

521
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,604
Thought you were calling me.

522
00:30:57,188 --> 00:31:00,108
No, this Anus.
Number One just sounds wrong.

523
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:01,401
How's the patient?

524
00:31:01,484 --> 00:31:03,069
Uh, spontaneous breathing is good.

525
00:31:03,152 --> 00:31:04,988
We're holding off on sedatives
until she wakes.

526
00:31:05,071 --> 00:31:08,283
Wait, the operation
was a success, right? Huh?

527
00:31:08,366 --> 00:31:11,995
Keep calling her name out.
She'll respond to a familiar voice.

528
00:31:13,037 --> 00:31:13,955
Ji-yeong.

529
00:31:14,581 --> 00:31:15,999
Ji-yeong, open your eyes.

530
00:31:16,082 --> 00:31:17,208
It's Dad.

531
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:19,419
Ji-yeong, can you hear my voice?

532
00:31:21,087 --> 00:31:23,631
Han Ji-yeong. Try opening your eyes now.

533
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:32,307
Ji-yeong. Ji-yeong!

534
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:34,100
Ji-yeong! Ji-yeong, can you see Dad?

535
00:31:34,183 --> 00:31:36,352
Do you recognize your dad? Ji-yeong, you…

536
00:31:36,436 --> 00:31:40,189
- Maybe unfamiliar voices too, I guess.
- We're in a hospital right now.

537
00:31:40,273 --> 00:31:42,609
Please, stay calm.
The patient needs absolute rest.

538
00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:48,156
Wait, wait. Just, just, just wait. Wait.

539
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:51,868
Baek Kang-hyuk, I'm so very grateful.

540
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:55,204
But I don't know how
I can possibly repay you for this.

541
00:31:55,288 --> 00:31:56,414
Thank you so much.

542
00:31:58,166 --> 00:31:59,125
Yeah.

543
00:31:59,626 --> 00:32:01,294
There are plenty of ways, Doctor.

544
00:32:02,837 --> 00:32:03,755
Don't worry.

545
00:32:14,807 --> 00:32:15,850
Here you go.

546
00:32:18,728 --> 00:32:19,938
Thank you again.

547
00:32:20,855 --> 00:32:24,442
Yu-rim, let's start
by discussing the budget, yeah?

548
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:28,112
Oh, yes. Yes.

549
00:32:28,196 --> 00:32:30,823
I'll put a good word in
with Director Hong.

550
00:32:31,532 --> 00:32:35,286
Also, Dr. Han is what my colleagues say.

551
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:38,581
I'd prefer if you called me
that rather than Yu-rim.

552
00:32:38,665 --> 00:32:39,958
Okay, I get it.

553
00:32:40,708 --> 00:32:41,751
Appreciate that.

554
00:32:44,087 --> 00:32:46,714
Enough of that. Why don't we get back
to the matter at hand?

555
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:48,841
Uh, which is?

556
00:32:49,884 --> 00:32:53,054
I hear there are… stories floating around.

557
00:32:56,724 --> 00:32:58,142
Oh, right, that.

558
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:02,271
Just who the hell is
this Baek Kang-hyuk, hmm?

559
00:33:03,272 --> 00:33:04,399
You would know, right?

560
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:07,110
You were in
Doctors for International Peace, yeah?

561
00:33:07,694 --> 00:33:08,653
That's right.

562
00:33:09,153 --> 00:33:11,406
He was always an outsider.

563
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:15,159
You worked with him for six years.
You'd have an idea, right?

564
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:19,205
Not the whole six.
He wasn't with us last year.

565
00:33:19,288 --> 00:33:21,624
Huh? He wasn't there last year?

566
00:33:23,876 --> 00:33:26,379
I heard that certain groups
were scouting Dr. Baek.

567
00:33:26,879 --> 00:33:28,297
Sounded super shady.

568
00:33:28,381 --> 00:33:29,298
Shady?

569
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:31,759
I think it was in Afghanistan.

570
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:34,429
I heard he made a lot of money.

571
00:33:35,096 --> 00:33:36,347
He would save lives

572
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:38,683
and take them away.

573
00:33:39,892 --> 00:33:40,852
Take lives?

574
00:33:41,394 --> 00:33:44,689
It was a conflict zone.
Scalpels weren't always enough.

575
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:47,608
He used firearms too.

576
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:48,735
No!

577
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:51,988
What was the name of that group again?

578
00:33:52,947 --> 00:33:53,823
Ah!

579
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:55,950
"Black Wings."

580
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:03,750
That crazy bastard.

581
00:34:04,917 --> 00:34:06,919
They let a murderer like that
into our hospital!

582
00:34:07,503 --> 00:34:11,090
At tomorrow's meeting,
I will reveal all of this.

583
00:34:11,174 --> 00:34:12,675
I haven't told anybody else.

584
00:34:12,759 --> 00:34:14,510
Not one single person.

585
00:34:14,594 --> 00:34:15,553
Don't worry.

586
00:34:17,138 --> 00:34:18,097
But, you know,

587
00:34:18,806 --> 00:34:20,600
you do act like a dangerous man.

588
00:34:21,184 --> 00:34:23,978
I heard it was the largest private
military company in the world.

589
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:25,438
Well, anyways,

590
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:27,899
I looked into it.

591
00:34:27,982 --> 00:34:30,276
You didn't actually
do everything they said, right?

592
00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:31,986
You didn't kill people, right?

593
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:32,987
Dr. Han.

594
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:35,281
I can't imagine you doing
something like that for money.

595
00:34:35,364 --> 00:34:36,574
Sh.

596
00:34:38,618 --> 00:34:39,619
Dr. Han.

597
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:42,830
Remember these words well.

598
00:34:43,956 --> 00:34:47,085
What you don't know… can't hurt you.

599
00:35:04,227 --> 00:35:05,186
What the…

600
00:35:14,278 --> 00:35:17,615
Since Dr. Beck's arrival,
our trauma center has been crazy.

601
00:35:17,698 --> 00:35:20,993
And the thing with Ji-yeong too.
And remember Lee Gi-yeong?

602
00:35:21,077 --> 00:35:24,330
He was driving here after they told him
his father was brain-dead,

603
00:35:24,997 --> 00:35:26,457
but he got into an accident.

604
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:30,711
The medics even took him
to the same hospital as his dad.

605
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:34,423
And because the dad was an organ donor,
it meant that

606
00:35:34,924 --> 00:35:36,801
his son received the donor liver.

607
00:35:37,844 --> 00:35:38,761
Wow.

608
00:35:38,845 --> 00:35:40,263
I wonder if that's the reason.

609
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:44,559
His recovery is incredibly fast.
He's already off the ventilator.

610
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:49,272
<i>And I heard Lee Hye-yeong also</i>
<i>regained consciousness this morning.</i>

611
00:35:49,355 --> 00:35:51,107
<i>They're probably</i>
<i>with each other right now.</i>

612
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:52,400
You're here.

613
00:35:58,447 --> 00:35:59,490
You okay?

614
00:36:01,325 --> 00:36:03,995
<i>It's an intense job</i>
<i>working at the trauma center,</i>

615
00:36:04,078 --> 00:36:06,164
<i>but the experience is always rewarding.</i>

616
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:17,133
Are you crying?

617
00:36:18,676 --> 00:36:20,761
- I'm not crying.
- No.

618
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:25,474
What's wrong with you?

619
00:36:26,642 --> 00:36:29,353
Don't you ever
get emotional at work?

620
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:32,607
Why would I?
They're both alive. So what is it?

621
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:34,817
It was just really sad!

622
00:36:38,404 --> 00:36:42,241
God. What if their blood pressure rises?
Things could get really serious.

623
00:36:45,453 --> 00:36:46,829
Oh. Look, they finally arrived.

624
00:36:46,913 --> 00:36:48,456
…trauma center right here.

625
00:36:50,291 --> 00:36:52,376
I'm debuting today on TV.

626
00:36:53,753 --> 00:36:54,670
Huh?

627
00:36:58,549 --> 00:37:01,636
Organ donation falls under
the Ministry of Health and Welfare.

628
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:02,678
Right.

629
00:37:02,762 --> 00:37:04,972
They said they'd never seen
a case like this.

630
00:37:05,473 --> 00:37:08,142
They offered
to foot the entire bill for us.

631
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:09,310
Really?

632
00:37:09,393 --> 00:37:10,228
Yeah.

633
00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:13,564
Ah. In exchange for getting the story?

634
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:16,359
Well, I have no reason to tell them no.

635
00:37:16,442 --> 00:37:19,403
All I have to do is say,
"Thank you, thank you," and it's done.

636
00:37:19,946 --> 00:37:22,573
Plus, it's free PR,
and we really need that now.

637
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:23,532
What do you mean?

638
00:37:23,616 --> 00:37:26,702
I've gotten into a number of dirty fights
over the years.

639
00:37:26,786 --> 00:37:29,705
And do you know what the secret
to always winning a fight is?

640
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:33,584
You have to overwhelm the other side.

641
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:35,169
So that means

642
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:38,172
we need as many people
as we can get on our side.

643
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:40,549
Yes, I'm coming.

644
00:37:43,594 --> 00:37:44,428
You coming?

645
00:37:44,512 --> 00:37:46,889
No, thank you.
I'm gonna keep studying for now.

646
00:37:48,849 --> 00:37:49,809
You do that.

647
00:37:50,893 --> 00:37:52,603
- Please say a few words.
- Dr. Baek!

648
00:37:52,687 --> 00:37:55,022
Do you have any comments
about the accident?

649
00:37:55,815 --> 00:37:57,608
You saved so many lives.

650
00:38:00,403 --> 00:38:01,862
Just like you wanted.

651
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:03,823
This will be broadcasted live.

652
00:38:03,906 --> 00:38:07,576
We already made local news.
Why not go nationwide?

653
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:10,871
Dr. Baek Kang-hyuk.
My name is Nam Su-ho of Goryeo TV.

654
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:13,499
I must say that I was very touched
to hear the story.

655
00:38:13,582 --> 00:38:16,127
Tell us. As the first doctor
to treat them, could you explain…

656
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:18,004
Whose phone is that?

657
00:38:18,087 --> 00:38:19,964
Turn it off.

658
00:38:20,047 --> 00:38:22,133
- Come on, turn it off!
- Oh, oh, oh.

659
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:24,593
AN JUNG-HEON
NATIONAL RESCUE UNIT

660
00:38:24,677 --> 00:38:27,513
- Turn it off, please.
- Hello. Dr. Baek of trauma surgery.

661
00:38:27,596 --> 00:38:29,557
Just a moment. Huh?

662
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:32,560
Huh? Hello?

663
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:33,936
I can't hear you.

664
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:35,521
I'm a little busy right now.

665
00:38:35,604 --> 00:38:37,148
Just a moment. Just a moment.

666
00:38:37,732 --> 00:38:38,858
Hello?

667
00:38:40,276 --> 00:38:41,777
Ah, shut it!

668
00:38:45,614 --> 00:38:46,782
Just shut it!

669
00:38:51,454 --> 00:38:54,457
Ah. Yes, Mr. An?
No, I wasn't speaking to you, Mr. An.

670
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:57,418
It sounds like there's a patient
in need of urgent care.

671
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:09,180
Oh. This actually exists.

672
00:39:17,688 --> 00:39:19,106
{\an8}"Black Wings."

673
00:39:20,524 --> 00:39:22,276
"Black Wings."

674
00:39:28,574 --> 00:39:30,618
- Yes, Dr. Baek?
<i>- Number One.</i>

675
00:39:30,701 --> 00:39:33,371
<i>Hey, have you overcome</i>
<i>your fear of heights yet?</i>

676
00:39:33,454 --> 00:39:34,622
No.

677
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:36,499
Well, it's time to ride again.

678
00:39:36,999 --> 00:39:39,126
Don't forget my shoes and the trauma kit.

679
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:41,253
Just come to the heliport.

680
00:39:41,837 --> 00:39:43,214
Yep.

681
00:39:48,677 --> 00:39:49,553
Huh?

682
00:39:51,472 --> 00:39:52,306
Huh?

683
00:39:56,811 --> 00:39:57,728
Huh?

684
00:40:09,281 --> 00:40:11,033
- Hold this.
- Yes, Dr. Baek.

685
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:28,717
Huh?

686
00:40:34,974 --> 00:40:35,808
Huh?

687
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:45,568
Dr. Baek, by the way,
do you know the "Black Wings"?
