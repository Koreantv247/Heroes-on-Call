00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:17,368
- Dr. Baek. His BP's dropping!
- 50 over 30!

4
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:20,580
- Let me transfuse directly.
- What?

5
00:01:20,663 --> 00:01:22,957
- No. You can't!
- We'll lose him otherwise.

6
00:03:03,391 --> 00:03:04,809
One, two, three.

7
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:08,479
Gangster, make sure we have enough blood.

8
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:09,522
Yes, Doctor.

9
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:11,065
No. 1, we'll start with the abdomen.

10
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:12,483
- Start draping.
- Yes, sir.

ABDOMINAL BULLET/NECROSIS REMOVAL

12
00:03:55,944 --> 00:03:57,403
You may begin the surgery now.

13
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:59,489
{\an8}- Energy device.
- Here.

{\an8}ENERGY DEVICE: USES HIGH FREQUENCY

15
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:04,619
Are you removing
all of the infected small bowel?

16
00:04:04,702 --> 00:04:06,287
It looks like at least one meter.

17
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:07,372
It's two meters.

18
00:04:07,455 --> 00:04:10,667
All necrotic tissue must be removed
for him to survive.

19
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:55,086
Irrigation.

20
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:03,136
We've at least finished clearing
the source of infection.

21
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:11,352
{\an8}We'll create a stoma
and let the rest of the bowels rest.

22
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:13,438
What about the bullet?

23
00:05:13,521 --> 00:05:14,939
We can't leave it inside.

24
00:05:15,773 --> 00:05:16,899
We need to find it.

25
00:05:17,775 --> 00:05:19,736
Will the patient hold up long enough?

26
00:05:20,903 --> 00:05:22,530
The bullet is not in here.

27
00:05:22,613 --> 00:05:23,573
It's in there.

28
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:24,657
The small bowel?

29
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:26,075
It needs to be in there.

30
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:30,496
If the bullet is still in his abdomen,
I can't save him.

31
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:31,998
Take that outside and find it.

32
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:35,126
- Otherwise, it'll contaminate the OR.
- Yes, Doctor.

33
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:41,257
Please come out already.

34
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:43,801
Come on.

35
00:05:56,105 --> 00:05:57,607
Go rest if it's too much.

36
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:00,693
You deserve it. It's all right.

37
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:02,945
I'm okay, sir. He's my patient too.

38
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:16,209
This is it!

39
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:28,429
We're done with his abdomen.

40
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:30,932
Now we'll reconstruct his left arm.

41
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:32,725
His left arm?

42
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:34,977
With the bone cut out? How?

43
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:38,815
We'll replace the infected bone
with the new one.

44
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:44,779
<i>A new bone?</i>

45
00:06:44,862 --> 00:06:45,696
<i>That's right.</i>

46
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:47,532
Get an artificial bone.

47
00:06:48,032 --> 00:06:48,950
Yes, sir.

Dr. Yang.

50
00:07:21,315 --> 00:07:22,233
Nurse.

51
00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:26,320
Just stay seated.

52
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:29,198
How are you feeling?

53
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:30,575
I'm all right.

54
00:07:30,658 --> 00:07:32,743
- How is the patient?
- The patient?

55
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:35,663
He's okay. Good vital signs.

56
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:37,748
That's a relief.

57
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:40,293
How are we getting home by the way?

58
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,880
Captain Lee's recovery will take a while.

59
00:07:44,505 --> 00:07:47,800
Indeed. We can't just take
any plane either.

60
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:11,717
- Hey.
- Yes?

61
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:13,135
Where are we anyway?

62
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,179
A military base?

63
00:09:18,015 --> 00:09:18,891
Actually,

64
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:21,561
Dr. Baek used to work here.

65
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:23,271
What?

66
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,941
Apparently, he was a medic
in a mercenary group

67
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:29,402
called "Black Wings."

68
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:30,611
And the Black…

69
00:09:31,862 --> 00:09:34,782
The Black Wings' African division
is here in South Sudan.

70
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:39,537
Captain Lee was destined to live.

71
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:40,454
By the way,

72
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:42,790
the pay here is…

73
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:45,668
The pay?

74
00:09:47,044 --> 00:09:48,462
Are they hiring nurses too?

75
00:09:54,468 --> 00:09:55,386
Dr. Baek!

76
00:10:05,521 --> 00:10:07,607
If you're done eating,
let's go back to Korea.

77
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:09,150
Right now?

78
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:11,777
Are we getting an air ambulance?

79
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:27,752
Wait.

80
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:29,837
Wow.

81
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:32,590
It's better equipped than most ICUs.

82
00:10:32,673 --> 00:10:33,633
Enough of that.

83
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:37,011
Just hurry along
and check on the medication and devices.

84
00:10:37,094 --> 00:10:39,180
Gyeong-won is bringing everything over.

85
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:42,642
Did I ask him to do it?

86
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:53,194
Dr. Park.

87
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:56,489
We need to talk.

88
00:11:00,951 --> 00:11:02,787
Sure. Good talk.

89
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:08,334
Don't we have unfinished business?

90
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,007
I'll come right out and ask you.

91
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:16,342
Are you a mole?

92
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:18,219
Yes.

93
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:23,140
Did the director put you up to it?

94
00:11:24,558 --> 00:11:25,476
Yes.

95
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,687
I won't tell Dr. Baek.

96
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:30,022
But in return,

97
00:11:31,148 --> 00:11:33,359
I'd like you to take on
all emergency surgeries.

98
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:35,861
Okay.

99
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:38,906
- What?
- I will do it.

100
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:40,950
Is there anything else?

101
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:43,703
Wait a second.

102
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:48,958
If you were ready to give in so easily,
why did you even bother spying?

103
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:53,254
Because someone had to do it.

104
00:11:54,171 --> 00:11:57,508
If I didn't do it, someone else
might have become a real mole.

105
00:11:59,301 --> 00:12:03,097
I was going to apply to the Trauma Center
after passing the boards.

106
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:05,975
So I don't want it to disappear.

107
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:10,396
- You're not crazy, are you?
- Yes.

108
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:11,897
I'm crazy.

109
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:14,984
This is great!

110
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:17,445
I can't wait to work with you.

111
00:12:17,945 --> 00:12:21,073
We need to get going.
Dr. Baek is looking for you. Let's hurry.

112
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:26,245
Let's go, Dr. Park.

113
00:12:26,328 --> 00:12:27,955
- Okay.
- Dr. Park?

114
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:33,627
Hey. You like that? Tell me!

115
00:12:34,211 --> 00:12:36,338
Hey. Are you ignoring me?

116
00:12:58,694 --> 00:13:00,780
<i>The plane carrying Captain Lee Hyeon-jong</i>

117
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:03,949

<i>at 8:00 a.m. local time.</i>

118
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:06,285
<i>Dr. Baek Kang-hyuk</i>
<i>was dispatched to South Sudan,</i>

119
00:13:06,368 --> 00:13:08,579
<i>where he successfully completed surgery.</i>

120
00:13:08,662 --> 00:13:11,749
<i>A decision was made to use</i>
<i>an air ambulance for a faster transfer.</i>

121
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:15,586
<i>They are expected to arrive in Seoul soon.</i>

122
00:13:15,669 --> 00:13:19,381
<i>Captain Lee Hyeon-jong's return</i>
<i>is drawing widespread public attention.</i>

123
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:21,759
Dr. Baek Kang-hyuk has proven his worth

124
00:13:21,842 --> 00:13:24,136
and put to rest
the allegations of cronyism.

125
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:27,515
He'll speak to the press upon his arrival.

126
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:30,309
Black Wings.

127
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:33,479
They're the world's largest PMC.

128
00:13:33,562 --> 00:13:35,481
It seems the surgery took place there.

129
00:13:37,107 --> 00:13:39,944
It turns out they also rented
the air ambulance from them.

130
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:45,032
This is good.
The public will eat this story up.

131
00:13:45,115 --> 00:13:46,700
<i>Dr. Baek Kang-hyuk</i>

132
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:49,787
formerly worked for the PMC
that arranged Captain Lee's surgery.

133
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:51,497
During his time as a medic,

134
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:54,500
he earned a substantial sum,

135
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:59,296
most of which he donated to be used
to purchase medicine for refugees.

136
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:04,969
Sometimes, a single pill worth 1,000 won

137
00:14:05,052 --> 00:14:08,055
can be more valuable
than having a doctor on hand.

138
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:09,598
Wouldn't you agree?

139
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:37,668
They are here.

140
00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:01,567
Welcome back.
Thank you for your hard work.

141
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:05,195
I kept my promise
and brought Captain Lee home alive.

142
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,781
This is about the EMS helicopter, right?

143
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:10,534
I'll make sure to hold up my end as well.

144
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:12,703
For now, let's go to the welcome ceremony.

145
00:15:12,786 --> 00:15:14,413
- This way.
- Just a moment!

146
00:15:14,496 --> 00:15:15,331
Dr. Baek!

147
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:21,128
- Move aside.
- One moment!

148
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:23,547
Attention, please!

149
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:24,465
Over there!

150
00:15:24,548 --> 00:15:27,760
Let me give you a quick update
on Captain Lee's condition.

151
00:15:31,513 --> 00:15:34,183
We were able to remove
the bullet lodged in his abdomen

152
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:36,518
during the second surgery.

153
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:41,148
We removed sections of the wounded area
and infected small bowel.

154
00:15:41,231 --> 00:15:42,358
Captain Lee Hyeon-jong

155
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,985
will return to active duty.

156
00:15:45,694 --> 00:15:49,031
I need to check on the patient,
so I'll leave the rest to you, Minister.

157
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:50,658
Yes, of course.

158
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:56,872
As you can see,
patients are his top priority.

159
00:16:00,334 --> 00:16:01,835
It's getting late. Let's hurry.

160
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:09,176
The Ministry of Health and Welfare
will provide unending support--

161
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,764
What? Who went where?

162
00:16:13,847 --> 00:16:15,349
Dr. Han is at the fire site.

163
00:16:15,432 --> 00:16:17,851
He received an urgent call
right before we left.

164
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:21,271
He must really see himself
as another Dr. Baek.

165
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:32,491
I am Baek Kang-hyuk.

166
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:34,618
I am…

167
00:16:46,463 --> 00:16:47,673
Car keys!

168
00:16:47,756 --> 00:16:49,299
Minister Kang, I need your car.

169
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:50,718
It's an emergency. Quick!

170
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:26,462
Luckily, the wounds aren't too deep.

171
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:28,088
Tell us if you have any issues.

172
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:30,174
Keep taking deep breaths!
Prepare for transport!

173
00:17:30,257 --> 00:17:32,676
Where does it hurt? Your shoulder?

174
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:55,532
You're clear to descend.

175
00:17:59,703 --> 00:18:01,080
- We're here!
- Over here!

176
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:03,749
Over here!

177
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:20,307
Head over to the ambulance
and make sure to get checked out. Okay?

178
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:21,850
- Okay.
- Let's get going.

179
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:22,810
Let's go!

180
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:29,191
- Mr. An.
- Dr. Baek!

181
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,819
- Are you back in the saddle?
- Yes.

182
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:33,403
What a grand welcome back.

183
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:35,948
They're from the rooftop, right?
Are you going back up?

184
00:18:36,031 --> 00:18:38,408
No. We've cleared the rooftop,

185
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:40,452
so I'm off to help at the fire site.

186
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:42,746
Don't send the helicopter back just yet.

187
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:44,581
- We might transport patients.
- Okay.

188
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:50,379
Relax.

189
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:52,589
How does it feel now?

190
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:56,093
What am I supposed to do?

191
00:18:57,928 --> 00:18:59,721
Come on! Damn it.

192
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:03,600
Thank you so…

193
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:04,977
Where's your safety gear?

194
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:06,812
Stop acting like a rookie.

195
00:19:06,895 --> 00:19:09,064
Dr. Baek!

196
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:11,150
What took you so long?

197
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:13,277
All this time, I've been all alone.

198
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,403
Come on!

199
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:16,655
What?

200
00:19:16,738 --> 00:19:17,781
You did well.

201
00:19:19,449 --> 00:19:21,368
Over here! We need help.

202
00:19:21,451 --> 00:19:22,786
Let's start by triaging.

203
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:25,289
We're too close to the fire.

204
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:28,458
Did you just get here?

205
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:31,879
You know this, right?

206
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:33,630
- This?
- Mr. An.

207
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:35,007
I have no idea!

208
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:36,842
How does this work?

209
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:49,813
When will the briefing start?

210
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:54,359
Listen up, everyone!
You can't do this here!

211
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:56,361
You should clear the entrance--

212
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:57,529
The ambulance is here!

213
00:19:57,613 --> 00:19:59,406
- The ambulance!
- Here it is!

214
00:20:08,248 --> 00:20:11,001
No! Stop!

215
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:17,007
For safe and prompt transport,
we need to work together as one.

216
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:20,594
When the doors open,
Dr. Yang, please lower the stretcher.

217
00:20:20,677 --> 00:20:21,553
You too, Agnes.

218
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:22,679
- Okay.
- Sure.

219
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:23,722
What about you?

220
00:20:25,432 --> 00:20:26,892
I'll clear a path in the center.

221
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:28,393
That's my specialty.

222
00:20:29,853 --> 00:20:31,313
On the count of three.

223
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:32,356
- Let's go.
- Okay.

224
00:20:33,106 --> 00:20:34,858
One, two, three!

225
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:37,027
No. Stop.

226
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:39,279
Move aside!

227
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:40,781
Clear the way!

228
00:20:59,549 --> 00:21:00,717
As for this patient…

229
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:03,845
This patient doesn't look good.

230
00:21:05,055 --> 00:21:06,473
Be careful. Watch out.

231
00:21:07,849 --> 00:21:08,725
Dr. Baek!

232
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:14,022
It turns out there are oxygen tanks
on the second floor.

233
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:15,774
We should evacuate immediately.

234
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:21,238
JEONGJUN INDUSTRIES MEDICAL GAS

235
00:21:21,321 --> 00:21:22,864
If there's an explosion,

236
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:24,866
everyone here will be in danger.

237
00:21:26,034 --> 00:21:27,369
Triaging is almost done.

238
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:29,454
- Let's start transporting them.
- Okay.

239
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:30,998
Rescue unit!

240
00:21:31,081 --> 00:21:32,874
Start transporting patients!

241
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,293
- Yes, sir!
- Yes!

242
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:37,879
Please make your way
toward the temporary shelter up ahead.

243
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:41,591
Rescue unit, move everyone
as safely and swiftly as possible.

244
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:45,178
Patients, I know this is tough,
but please try to keep up.

245
00:21:57,232 --> 00:21:58,608
Hang the fluids and follow me.

246
00:21:58,692 --> 00:21:59,901
- Okay.
- One last patient.

247
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:17,753
Dr. Baek!

248
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:20,839
Dr. Baek!

249
00:22:20,922 --> 00:22:22,716
- Dr. Baek.
- It's too dangerous.

250
00:22:27,971 --> 00:22:29,723
- Are you okay?
- Dr. Baek!

251
00:22:29,806 --> 00:22:33,393
The patient. Rescue the patient first.

252
00:22:35,145 --> 00:22:36,104
Dr. Baek!

253
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:45,280
Stay there.

254
00:22:55,415 --> 00:22:56,583
Are you okay?

255
00:22:56,666 --> 00:22:57,584
Dr. Baek.

256
00:22:58,168 --> 00:23:01,088
He likely has a burn in the airway,
so intubate immediately.

257
00:23:01,171 --> 00:23:02,672
- Okay.
- He may get dehydrated.

258
00:23:03,173 --> 00:23:05,258
- So give him fluids too.
- Okay. Got it.

259
00:23:05,967 --> 00:23:07,886
Mr. An, let's get in the helicopter.

260
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:10,138
- All right. Let's go.
- Okay.

261
00:23:23,151 --> 00:23:24,111
Mr. An.

262
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:26,321
Yes?

263
00:23:27,614 --> 00:23:29,449
Please call the Burn Unit attending.

264
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:30,659
I'm on it.

265
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:32,786
Why? You're not doing it yourself?

266
00:23:32,869 --> 00:23:34,329
Not up for surgery?

267
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:39,167
I have fragments lodged inside.

268
00:23:39,793 --> 00:23:43,547
Seeing as there's no bleeding,
it must be an internal organ burn.

269
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:44,464
What?

270
00:23:45,048 --> 00:23:46,383
Let me have a look.

271
00:23:47,717 --> 00:23:49,219
Can't you feel my fingers?

272
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:52,222
Necrosis must be underway.

273
00:23:52,806 --> 00:23:53,682
Dr. Baek!

274
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:55,517
Dr. Baek!

275
00:24:02,315 --> 00:24:04,609
It's been one heck of a ride back.

276
00:24:05,152 --> 00:24:07,946
I know.
It feels like we shot an entire film.

277
00:24:08,029 --> 00:24:10,323
All's well that ends well.

278
00:24:10,407 --> 00:24:13,368
We should get ready again.
We'll be swamped with patients soon.

279
00:24:14,911 --> 00:24:16,246
That's right. The fire.

280
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:18,999
Excuse me.

281
00:24:21,668 --> 00:24:22,669
Hello, Dr. Han.

282
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:25,714
Okay, I'll…

283
00:24:32,387 --> 00:24:33,472
Who?

284
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:39,978
Doc, what's the matter?

285
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,565
A patient is being brought in
by helicopter.

286
00:24:44,357 --> 00:24:45,358
And the patient is…

287
00:24:47,903 --> 00:24:49,154
Dr. Baek.

288
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:51,990
What do you mean?

289
00:24:53,241 --> 00:24:56,328
Dr. Baek has been injured.

290
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:02,834
- Doc!
- Emergency surgery.

291
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:04,878
- Call anesthesiology!
- Who's gonna operate?

292
00:25:04,961 --> 00:25:07,672
With Dr. Baek on the table,
who will perform the surgery?

293
00:25:21,269 --> 00:25:22,187
My breathing

294
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:24,105
keeps

295
00:25:25,815 --> 00:25:26,858
getting shallower.

296
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:28,735
- You know what that means.
- I do.

297
00:25:28,818 --> 00:25:31,613
Don't talk too much.
You should save your energy.

298
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:33,990
I'm doing my best to hold on right now.

299
00:25:36,243 --> 00:25:38,912
But the progression is too fast.

300
00:25:38,995 --> 00:25:40,163
All right. I get it!

301
00:25:40,247 --> 00:25:41,873
I'll give you a sedative for now.

302
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:44,543
No.

303
00:25:44,626 --> 00:25:46,461
I need to talk to No. 1.

304
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:48,296
Wait.

305
00:26:03,311 --> 00:26:04,437
Hey! Quickly!

306
00:26:05,689 --> 00:26:08,108
- One, two, three.
- Dr. Baek!

307
00:26:08,191 --> 00:26:09,442
- Move!
- All right.

308
00:26:10,026 --> 00:26:11,653
Come on. Dr. Baek.

309
00:26:11,736 --> 00:26:13,655
Stay with me. Let's go.

310
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:14,573
- Oh no.
- Careful.

311
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:15,574
- Oh my God.
- Here.

312
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:17,033
- Lie down here.
- Dr. Baek!

313
00:26:17,117 --> 00:26:18,702
- Lie down.
- Oh no.

314
00:26:18,785 --> 00:26:20,495
- Hey! Hurry!
- Yes?

315
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:22,664
- Quickly!
- Let's go!

316
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:24,040
- Let's go.
- Hurry!

317
00:26:24,124 --> 00:26:25,125
Just a moment!

318
00:26:26,459 --> 00:26:27,335
No. 1.

319
00:26:28,336 --> 00:26:30,380
- Yes?
- You can do it, right?

320
00:26:31,298 --> 00:26:32,132
What?

321
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:35,719
It's your call.

322
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:37,679
And yours alone.

323
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:41,808
- All right?
- Yes, Dr. Baek!

324
00:26:41,891 --> 00:26:42,726
Hurry!

325
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:43,893
Yes, let's go!

326
00:26:45,145 --> 00:26:46,605
We need to keep moving.

327
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:48,106
Don't stop!

328
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:12,839
<i>After this hallway…</i>

329
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:17,052
<i>we'll come to a crossroads.</i>

330
00:27:19,346 --> 00:27:20,722
<i>Over the past six months,</i>

331
00:27:20,805 --> 00:27:23,058
<i>I've been conflicted countless times…</i>

332
00:27:26,227 --> 00:27:27,479
<i>at that crossroads.</i>

333
00:27:31,566 --> 00:27:33,568
<i>Once I turn that corner, I…</i>

334
00:27:36,112 --> 00:27:37,405
<i>must make a decision.</i>

335
00:27:44,371 --> 00:27:46,414
<i>Where do I go?</i>

336
00:27:47,957 --> 00:27:51,002
<i>Which way should I go?</i>

337
00:27:51,586 --> 00:27:52,837
Which way are we going?

338
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:54,464
We need to get a CT first!

339
00:27:55,465 --> 00:27:56,633
Dr. Yang!

340
00:27:56,716 --> 00:27:58,593
<i>To the CT room for an initial checkup?</i>

341
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:00,345
- Doc!
- Jae-won!

342
00:28:01,971 --> 00:28:02,972
Dr. Yang!

343
00:28:03,556 --> 00:28:04,641
Jae-won, say something!

344
00:28:04,724 --> 00:28:05,809
<i>Or</i>

345
00:28:05,892 --> 00:28:08,937
<i>straight to the OR</i>
<i>to seize the golden hour?</i>

346
00:28:09,646 --> 00:28:11,314
Snap out of it, Doc!

347
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:16,486
<i>The decision…</i>

348
00:28:19,781 --> 00:28:21,491
<i>is in the lead surgeon's hands.</i>

349
00:28:27,914 --> 00:28:29,082
What are you doing?

350
00:28:30,291 --> 00:28:31,501
You're not getting a CT?

351
00:28:36,131 --> 00:28:38,258
- Dr. Park.
- What's the situation?

352
00:28:38,341 --> 00:28:41,261
- There's hot metal in his abdomen--
- How deep is the wound?

353
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:44,723
I don't know.

354
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:47,183
I can't see through his body.

355
00:28:47,934 --> 00:28:49,894
How could you sound so irresponsible?

356
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:51,771
Don't we need a CT scan?

357
00:28:51,855 --> 00:28:53,898
We're going right into surgery. Get ready.

358
00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:55,984
We need to know the extent of the wound.

359
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:58,820
One wrong move could kill him.

360
00:28:58,903 --> 00:28:59,738
Well said.

361
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:02,407
- Jae-won, Dr. Park has a point.
- No.

362
00:29:03,533 --> 00:29:05,702
We're jumping straight in, Dr. Han.
Trust me.

363
00:29:05,785 --> 00:29:06,661
Please.

364
00:29:10,331 --> 00:29:11,166
Hey.

365
00:29:12,709 --> 00:29:13,710
Are you the surgeon?

366
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:18,757
Let's play nice now.

367
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,717
I'll try to rustle up some attendings.

368
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,635
- Let's all join forces--
- No.

369
00:29:22,719 --> 00:29:24,471
We don't have enough time, Dr. Han.

370
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:27,182
I'll perform the surgery.

371
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:28,308
For God's sake.

372
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:31,436
- Dr. Yang, should we start disinfecting?
- Yes.

373
00:29:33,229 --> 00:29:35,482
- I'd like you to assist.
- Dr. Yang!

374
00:29:38,568 --> 00:29:39,986
Please, Dr. Han.

375
00:29:47,327 --> 00:29:48,495
All right, then.

376
00:29:49,078 --> 00:29:51,039
Let's get that hunk of metal
out of him first.

377
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:57,420
Please handle the anesthesia.
I'll be right in once I scrub in.

378
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:04,677
Dr. Park.

379
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:09,349
Why don't we each stick
to what we do best?

380
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:13,436
Please help me with this one.

381
00:30:26,741 --> 00:30:28,535
Let's say I remove the metal,

382
00:30:29,702 --> 00:30:31,788
what do I do about the periwound?

383
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:44,759
<i>The decision</i>

384
00:30:46,261 --> 00:30:48,012
<i>is in the lead surgeon's hands.</i>

385
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:54,352
SURGERY IN PROGRESS

386
00:31:11,995 --> 00:31:13,204
Commencing

387
00:31:13,788 --> 00:31:14,747
the operation.

388
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:17,542
Scalpel.

389
00:31:23,172 --> 00:31:29,721
{\an8}NAME: BAEK KANG-HYUK, GENDER: MALE
INTERNAL ORGAN BURNS

390
00:32:03,504 --> 00:32:05,548
THE FIRST GUY I'VE MET
WHO'S COOLER THAN MY DAD!

391
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:07,050
{\an8}THANK YOU
I'LL LIVE TO THE FULLEST

392
00:32:07,133 --> 00:32:09,928
{\an8}YOU MAKE ME WANNA STAY HERE!
THANK YOU, DOCTOR!

393
00:32:10,011 --> 00:32:11,179
{\an8}GOING HOME! THANK YOU

394
00:32:37,664 --> 00:32:39,332
<i>Am I dead?</i>

395
00:32:40,875 --> 00:32:43,753
CONGRATULATIONS, YOU'RE STILL ALIVE

396
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:02,397
What is it?

397
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:05,066
There you are.

398
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:07,193
Why aren't you going in?

399
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:12,073
The lead surgeon
should be the first to check in.

400
00:33:27,922 --> 00:33:30,258
Dr. Baek. Are you all right?

401
00:33:32,802 --> 00:33:34,470
What happened to the fire victim?

402
00:33:37,432 --> 00:33:40,643
Dr. Park from the Burn Unit stepped in.
He's now in the general ward.

403
00:33:40,727 --> 00:33:42,270
His prognosis is good too.

404
00:33:43,813 --> 00:33:46,149
Who treated the other patients
while I was out?

405
00:33:47,567 --> 00:33:49,402
We've had quite a few traffic accidents,

406
00:33:49,485 --> 00:33:51,779
so there have been
many orthopedic patients.

407
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:54,824
Dr. Im from the ER and Dr. Jung
from orthopedics helped out a lot.

408
00:33:54,907 --> 00:33:56,159
No fatalities so far.

409
00:33:59,746 --> 00:34:00,747
No. 1.

410
00:34:01,497 --> 00:34:02,331
Yes, Dr. Baek.

411
00:34:02,832 --> 00:34:04,500
According to the chart,

412
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:07,211
you cut me open without a CT scan.

413
00:34:07,754 --> 00:34:10,173
Do you mean your surgery?

414
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:14,218
You said yourself, Dr. Baek,
that I should decide for myself.

415
00:34:14,302 --> 00:34:15,595
That was my decision.

416
00:34:15,678 --> 00:34:17,263
- The surgery couldn't wait--
- Right.

417
00:34:17,764 --> 00:34:19,307
What was the basis for that?

418
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:25,438
The patient's condition.

419
00:34:25,521 --> 00:34:29,609
In trauma surgery, the patient's condition
matters more than textbook knowledge.

420
00:34:29,692 --> 00:34:31,611
That's what you told me.

421
00:34:31,694 --> 00:34:33,321
What was my condition?

422
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:39,786
The heat kept spreading nonstop.

423
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:42,747
So I figured there would be
cumulative damage.

424
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:45,500
As time passed,
the damage would only accelerate.

425
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:47,585
I realized it might cause liver failure.

426
00:34:48,169 --> 00:34:49,003
Yes.

427
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:51,214
So I made my decision.

428
00:34:54,383 --> 00:34:55,593
Did you cut out

429
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:57,678
a third of my liver?

430
00:34:58,805 --> 00:35:01,641
That's bordering
on a living-donor liver transplant.

431
00:35:02,975 --> 00:35:04,519
Yes. That's right.

432
00:35:05,561 --> 00:35:06,729
You little bastard.

433
00:35:06,813 --> 00:35:08,189
You almost killed me.

434
00:35:13,694 --> 00:35:14,987
But you're still alive.

435
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:19,450
That's true.

436
00:35:22,995 --> 00:35:24,330
I'm sorry, Dr. Baek.

437
00:35:25,998 --> 00:35:27,125
No.

438
00:35:28,417 --> 00:35:29,919
I'm saying you did a good job,

439
00:35:31,295 --> 00:35:32,505
Dr. Yang Jae-won.

440
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:41,013
What?

441
00:35:43,099 --> 00:35:47,436
Dr. Baek. Did you just call me by my name?

442
00:35:47,937 --> 00:35:48,938
Yes.

443
00:35:49,021 --> 00:35:50,773
You've finally earned your name.

444
00:35:59,615 --> 00:36:00,908
- Fuck.
- What?

445
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:05,288
Fuck!

446
00:36:08,958 --> 00:36:11,002
What's up with him?

447
00:36:11,085 --> 00:36:12,003
Dr. Baek!

448
00:36:12,587 --> 00:36:13,963
Let's just all go in.

449
00:36:14,046 --> 00:36:15,256
Why is he cursing?

450
00:36:16,299 --> 00:36:18,676
- Why? What happened?
- Dr. Baek.

451
00:36:18,759 --> 00:36:20,178
Wow. Let me see.

452
00:36:20,261 --> 00:36:22,263
- Dr. Baek. Are you okay?
- Go away.

453
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:24,682
We've all been worried sick.

454
00:36:24,765 --> 00:36:25,850
Fucking hell!

455
00:36:25,933 --> 00:36:28,436
Stop kicking up a racket in the ICU!
Just shut up.

456
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:29,687
Hey, be careful!

457
00:36:30,271 --> 00:36:32,523
All that cursing shows he's alive.

458
00:36:32,607 --> 00:36:33,858
Let's calm down a bit.

459
00:36:33,941 --> 00:36:35,693
You've been to hell and back.

460
00:36:35,776 --> 00:36:36,944
He's still a patient.

461
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:38,487
- Did you see that?
- Are you okay?

462
00:36:38,571 --> 00:36:40,573
- "You're still alive."
- Still alive.

463
00:36:40,656 --> 00:36:42,366
- Please leave me alone.
- All right.

464
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:47,288
<i>Onto the next story.</i>

465
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:50,833
<i>The two heroes of South Sudan,</i>
<i>Captain Lee and Dr. Baek,</i>

466
00:36:50,917 --> 00:36:52,418
<i>are making headlines day after day.</i>

467
00:36:52,501 --> 00:36:55,963
<i>In particular, Dr. Baek's interview</i>
<i>about the need for EMS helicopters</i>

468
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:58,424
<i>is creating quite a stir.</i>

469
00:36:58,507 --> 00:37:02,303
<i>Dr. Baek's sincere pleas</i>
<i>have garnered public support.</i>

470
00:37:02,386 --> 00:37:06,140
{\an8}In the Trauma Center,
every single moment

471
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:07,808
{\an8}is a life-and-death situation.

472
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:09,602
<i>A helicopter is crucial.</i>

473
00:37:10,478 --> 00:37:14,023
<i>Still, we are unable to bring in</i>
<i>an EMS helicopter</i>

474
00:37:14,106 --> 00:37:15,524
<i>solely because of money.</i>

475
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:19,820
<i>We must stop being stingy</i>
<i>with life-saving resources.</i>

476
00:37:20,947 --> 00:37:22,114
<i>I'd like to ask all of you</i>

477
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:24,575
<i>to join me in putting an end</i>

478
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:27,119
<i>to the old way of thinking.</i>

479
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:31,415
<i>In response to Dr. Baek's urgent call</i>
<i>for EMS helicopters</i>

480
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:33,960
<i>to tap into the golden hour,</i>

481
00:37:34,043 --> 00:37:35,461
<i>various civic groups</i>

482
00:37:35,544 --> 00:37:37,838
<i>have issued statements of support.</i>

483
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:40,883
<i>Public interest in the matter</i>
<i>is rising significantly.</i>

484
00:37:40,967 --> 00:37:44,887
<i>The government plans to expand</i>
<i>the EMS helicopter service nationwide</i>

485
00:37:44,971 --> 00:37:46,847
<i>within the next three years.</i>

486
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:49,684
<i>As a government office,</i>
<i>we promise to do our utmost</i>

487
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:52,144
<i>for the people of this country.</i>

488
00:37:52,228 --> 00:37:55,648
<i>There is growing anticipation</i>
<i>that this could be the first step</i>

489
00:37:55,731 --> 00:38:00,403
<i>in implementing a trauma care system</i>
<i>on par with those in advanced countries.</i>

490
00:38:02,363 --> 00:38:04,323
Honey, you have a visitor.

491
00:38:14,667 --> 00:38:17,169
Why aren't you coming into work?

492
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:20,923
Did you think avoiding me
until tomorrow's emergency board meeting

493
00:38:21,007 --> 00:38:22,300
would be the solution?

494
00:38:22,383 --> 00:38:25,094
All that nonsense about a heliport
and an EMS helicopter.

495
00:38:25,177 --> 00:38:27,096
No matter what you do,

496
00:38:27,179 --> 00:38:29,265
you can't stop tomorrow's meeting.

497
00:38:29,348 --> 00:38:32,518
The motion to revoke your appointment
will be proposed tomorrow.

498
00:38:33,227 --> 00:38:34,145
Director Choi.

499
00:38:34,854 --> 00:38:39,525
If you fire me just like that,
you'll probably face huge public backlash.

500
00:38:39,608 --> 00:38:43,237
It doesn't change the fact
that you were appointed due to cronyism.

501
00:38:44,363 --> 00:38:46,407
The reasoning is more than solid.

502
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:47,450
Director Choi.

503
00:38:48,075 --> 00:38:50,161
I see where you're coming from.

504
00:38:50,745 --> 00:38:53,664
I'm truly doing this
for the sake of the patients.

505
00:38:53,748 --> 00:38:57,960
Exactly. The National Rescue Unit
has pledged its full support!

506
00:38:58,044 --> 00:38:59,670
- So why on earth--
- No.

507
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:03,507
It comes with limitations.
We must be able to respond at night too.

508
00:39:03,591 --> 00:39:07,845
So you want it to operate 24/7, do you?
Are you out to wreck our hospital?

509
00:39:07,928 --> 00:39:10,389
Do you think the board will agree to that?

510
00:39:10,473 --> 00:39:12,725
- If you put it on the agenda--
- Hey, kid!

511
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:14,185
You!

512
00:39:15,144 --> 00:39:17,146
What are you trying to accomplish here?

513
00:39:17,813 --> 00:39:20,024
Why our hospital, of all places?

514
00:39:21,734 --> 00:39:25,112
Are you plotting with Director Oh
to ruin my life?

515
00:39:28,157 --> 00:39:30,785
Why did I join
Hankuk National University Hospital?

516
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:36,040
To tell you that story,

517
00:39:36,916 --> 00:39:39,752
maybe I should begin by explaining
why I became a doctor.

518
00:39:40,753 --> 00:39:42,129
What are you talking about?

519
00:39:44,924 --> 00:39:45,841
Here goes.

520
00:39:48,928 --> 00:39:50,554
My father passed away.

521
00:39:52,765 --> 00:39:54,600
He was in a serious accident.

522
00:39:57,144 --> 00:40:00,606
He was taken to several hospitals,
but none would take him in.

523
00:40:00,689 --> 00:40:02,983
After going round and round
in desperation,

524
00:40:04,276 --> 00:40:07,738
he was pronounced dead
at Hankuk National University Hospital.

525
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:12,368
That day,

526
00:40:13,494 --> 00:40:14,412
the doctor

527
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:18,457
didn't give up until the very end.

528
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:21,460
Even after the golden hour was long gone.

529
00:40:22,628 --> 00:40:26,298
13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20,

530
00:40:26,382 --> 00:40:29,510
21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26…

531
00:40:34,765 --> 00:40:36,016
<i>That day, I decided</i>…

532
00:40:38,018 --> 00:40:40,020
<i>that I should become a doctor too.</i>

533
00:40:43,899 --> 00:40:45,109
<i>Just like that man.</i>

534
00:40:52,158 --> 00:40:54,160
<i>I wanted to become a doctor like you.</i>

535
00:40:55,661 --> 00:40:57,079
The doctor that you were

536
00:40:58,247 --> 00:40:59,290
24 years ago.

537
00:41:03,085 --> 00:41:05,713
The one who did his best
to save his patients.

538
00:41:07,756 --> 00:41:09,550
Where is that doctor now?

539
00:41:53,594 --> 00:41:56,639
EMERGENCY BOARD MEETING AGENDA
HELIPORT AND EMS HELICOPTER

540
00:42:01,101 --> 00:42:04,688
{\an8}APPROVED BY DIRECTOR CHOI JO-EUN

541
00:42:09,985 --> 00:42:11,695
- Is everyone here?
- Yes, sir.

542
00:42:12,196 --> 00:42:14,740
You can take pictures,
but don't get too close.

543
00:42:14,823 --> 00:42:16,534
It's still brand new. Okay?

544
00:42:16,617 --> 00:42:19,078
- Are all the reporters here?
- Yes, sir.

545
00:42:19,578 --> 00:42:20,621
Director Choi.

546
00:42:20,704 --> 00:42:22,414
There you are. Director Choi.

547
00:42:33,509 --> 00:42:36,804
Was yours a gift from Dr. Baek too?

548
00:42:37,513 --> 00:42:38,639
Yours too?

549
00:42:42,726 --> 00:42:43,852
Let's laugh it off.

550
00:42:43,936 --> 00:42:45,229
Let's not spoil the mood.

551
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:47,565
Hello.

552
00:42:47,648 --> 00:42:49,441
Here comes Minister Kang.

553
00:42:51,986 --> 00:42:52,987
Good to see you all.

554
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:56,657
- Thank you for coming all this way.
- I wouldn't miss it for the world.

555
00:42:57,950 --> 00:42:59,285
Where is Dr. Baek?

556
00:42:59,368 --> 00:43:00,452
- Dr. Baek?
- Yes.

557
00:43:00,536 --> 00:43:03,789
The Society of Surgery
is having its autumn conference today,

558
00:43:03,872 --> 00:43:05,457
and he couldn't miss it.

559
00:43:05,541 --> 00:43:07,001
- He'll do fine.
- Thank you.

560
00:43:07,084 --> 00:43:08,711
- Congrats.
- Please have a seat.

561
00:43:08,794 --> 00:43:11,463
- Are you two in matching outfits today?
- Yes, ma'am.

562
00:43:13,549 --> 00:43:14,592
Hello.

563
00:43:14,675 --> 00:43:15,718
Welcome.

564
00:43:17,344 --> 00:43:21,473
8TH KOREAN SOCIETY OF SURGERY
AUTUMN CONFERENCE

565
00:43:21,557 --> 00:43:23,392
Why did you all sign up for surgery?

566
00:43:23,934 --> 00:43:27,354
Isn't it because you wanted to be
on the front lines of saving lives?

567
00:43:27,896 --> 00:43:31,483
But you can't find those front lines
just anywhere.

568
00:43:31,567 --> 00:43:35,237
That's why I've come here today.

569
00:43:36,238 --> 00:43:37,448
What is he on about?

570
00:43:39,116 --> 00:43:42,369
These are applications for trauma surgery.

571
00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:44,997
The form outlines potential improvements

572
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:47,207
to working conditions
at the Trauma Center.

573
00:43:47,291 --> 00:43:48,459
Please read it carefully.

574
00:43:48,542 --> 00:43:51,545
After five to six years
of slogging under my direction,

575
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:55,132
you could become the next Baek Kang-hyuk.

576
00:43:55,215 --> 00:43:57,551
Within the next three years,

577
00:43:57,635 --> 00:44:01,096
we aim to establish trauma centers
in all municipalities.

578
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:03,182
So everything's up in the air.

579
00:44:05,726 --> 00:44:07,019
Nothing is confirmed.

580
00:44:07,102 --> 00:44:08,395
That little…

581
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:15,653
Dr. Baek. Let's just drop it.

582
00:44:15,736 --> 00:44:16,612
What?

583
00:44:16,695 --> 00:44:18,656
These kids can't save lives.

584
00:44:18,739 --> 00:44:20,783
Every second counts in the Trauma Center.

585
00:44:20,866 --> 00:44:23,994
This kind of hesitation
would cost patients' lives.

586
00:44:25,829 --> 00:44:27,164
Leave.

587
00:44:27,247 --> 00:44:29,458
Get out of here! Go!

588
00:44:29,541 --> 00:44:31,085
I have a question.

589
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:47,267
You're Seo Dong-ju
from South Sudan, aren't you?

590
00:44:47,935 --> 00:44:51,397
If I join the Trauma Center,
what's going to happen?

591
00:44:53,774 --> 00:44:55,401
The working conditions will be--

592
00:44:55,484 --> 00:44:56,318
No.

593
00:44:57,820 --> 00:44:59,446
What can I do

594
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:00,823
at the Trauma Center?

595
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:02,700
That's what I'm asking.

596
00:45:04,868 --> 00:45:06,412
You'll be able to save lives.

597
00:45:10,874 --> 00:45:13,711
Isn't that why you all became doctors
in the first place?

598
00:45:16,088 --> 00:45:17,214
Now,

599
00:45:17,297 --> 00:45:20,342
I'm offering you the chance
to become real doctors.

600
00:45:20,426 --> 00:45:22,511
Only for the first 50.

601
00:45:28,684 --> 00:45:29,560
Welcome aboard,

602
00:45:29,643 --> 00:45:30,519
No. 2.

603
00:45:32,354 --> 00:45:33,355
No. 2?

604
00:45:33,439 --> 00:45:34,356
Yes.

605
00:45:36,442 --> 00:45:39,361
{\an8}The HNUH Trauma Center's EMS helicopter

606
00:45:39,445 --> 00:45:43,490
is a masterpiece crafted
by the Italian company, AgustaWestland.

607
00:45:43,574 --> 00:45:45,659
Its stability during nighttime flights

608
00:45:45,743 --> 00:45:49,496
allows us to respond to patients
at any time of day.

609
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:51,665
At long last,

610
00:45:51,749 --> 00:45:54,251
Hankuk National University Hospital

611
00:45:54,334 --> 00:45:56,462
has the advanced equipment to provide--

612
00:45:56,545 --> 00:45:58,464
Sorry we're late!

613
00:46:09,391 --> 00:46:10,726
Welcome, Dr. Baek.

614
00:46:12,519 --> 00:46:14,688
Here comes Dr. Baek Kang-hyuk.

615
00:46:14,772 --> 00:46:16,607
The star of the show is at it again.

616
00:46:17,191 --> 00:46:18,734
I'd say he has a condition.

617
00:46:18,817 --> 00:46:20,778
- I still have a bit left.
- Step aside.

618
00:46:21,737 --> 00:46:25,866
About that biography you're writing,
did you get Dr. Baek's permission?

619
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:27,701
His permission?

620
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:29,453
No.

621
00:46:30,245 --> 00:46:32,122
I'm just going to change his name

622
00:46:32,206 --> 00:46:35,000
and start a web fiction series next week.

623
00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:40,130
That sounds risky.

624
00:46:40,214 --> 00:46:42,424
Hello. I am Baek Kang-hyuk.

625
00:46:42,966 --> 00:46:45,761
I usually hate
putting myself out there like this.

626
00:46:45,844 --> 00:46:48,263
But I felt I really had to say something

627
00:46:48,347 --> 00:46:51,433
about the role of the Trauma Center.

628
00:46:52,392 --> 00:46:53,811
Now, at the Trauma Center--

629
00:46:56,271 --> 00:46:57,231
Excuse me.

630
00:46:58,524 --> 00:47:00,943
MR. AN JUNG-HEON
NATIONAL RESCUE UNIT

631
00:47:01,026 --> 00:47:03,821
- If I may add a few words--
- Yes, Mr. An.

632
00:47:06,198 --> 00:47:07,658
We'll take off right away.

633
00:47:07,741 --> 00:47:10,285
- Take off?
- No need for a long explanation.

634
00:47:10,369 --> 00:47:12,287
I present to you

635
00:47:12,371 --> 00:47:14,623
the Trauma Center.

636
00:47:14,706 --> 00:47:15,541
Jae-won, let's go.

637
00:47:15,624 --> 00:47:16,834
- Yes, sir.
- Are you off?

638
00:47:16,917 --> 00:47:17,960
Let's prepare an OR.

639
00:47:18,043 --> 00:47:19,127
Let's go, Gyeong-won.

640
00:47:19,211 --> 00:47:20,045
Go to the OR.

641
00:47:20,128 --> 00:47:22,047
We have an emergency situation here.

642
00:47:22,130 --> 00:47:23,423
The chopper is taking off.

643
00:47:23,507 --> 00:47:24,675
Take your chair with you.

644
00:47:24,758 --> 00:47:27,177
- Grab the mic.
- It'll blow everything away.

645
00:47:27,761 --> 00:47:29,847
- Hurry!
- Is the helicopter even cleared to fly?

646
00:47:29,930 --> 00:47:31,557
- Let's go!
- Move it.

647
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:34,601
Are we sure it can take off?
Has it passed its safety checks?

648
00:47:34,685 --> 00:47:36,270
This isn't on me. I don't know.

649
00:47:47,906 --> 00:47:50,325
Dr. Yang,
are you okay with helicopter rides now?

650
00:47:50,409 --> 00:47:52,119
"Dr. Yang" sounds a little awkward.

651
00:47:52,202 --> 00:47:54,538
Let's stick to "No. 1"
until we get to about No. 5.

652
00:47:54,621 --> 00:47:55,998
Really? All right, Anus.

653
00:47:56,081 --> 00:47:58,292
What? That's right back to square one.

654
00:47:58,375 --> 00:48:00,878
You must never forget where you started.

655
00:48:00,961 --> 00:48:03,505
- Don't you think, Anus?
- Dr. Yang is fine.

656
00:48:03,589 --> 00:48:05,799
<i>- Let's go with Dr. Yang.</i>
<i>- Sure, Dr. Anus.</i>

657
00:48:05,883 --> 00:48:06,884
<i>Let's go!</i>

658
00:48:14,892 --> 00:48:17,477
WE EXTEND OUR DEEPEST GRATITUDE
TO ALL MEDICAL STAFF

659
00:48:17,561 --> 00:48:20,647
WHO WORK TIRELESSLY EVERY DAY
AT THE FRONT LINES OF SAVING LIVES

660
00:53:09,603 --> 00:53:14,608
