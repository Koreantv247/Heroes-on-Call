THE TRAUMA CODE: HEROES ON CALL

2
00:01:20,288 --> 00:01:21,414
<i>Ah, shut it!</i>

3
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:23,583
<i>Shut it! Just shut it!</i>

4
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:26,711
<i>Sh-sh-sh… Shu-shu… Shut it! Shu… Shut it!</i>

5
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:28,671
- Is he saying "shut it"?
- That was live.

6
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:30,757
<i>Shut! Shut! Shut! Just shut it!</i>

7
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:34,886
<i>It…</i>

8
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,723
Oh no!

9
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:42,560
Oh my gosh.

10
00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:44,104
<i>Just shut… Just shut… Just shut it!</i>

11
00:01:44,187 --> 00:01:47,023
He got what he asked for,
and now his face is everywhere.

12
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:50,110
Ah, these photos don't do him justice.

13
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:51,444
<i>Shut it!</i>

14
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:54,114
DR. BAEK KANG-HYUK OF HNUH
TV INTERVIEW DRAMA

15
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:55,949
Damn it. This is…

16
00:01:58,243 --> 00:02:01,121
I guess I didn't account for
something like this.

17
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:09,420
I should have been there to see
the expression on Minister Kang's face.

18
00:02:09,504 --> 00:02:12,715
Ah, the news is having a field day
with this. Yeah.

19
00:02:14,342 --> 00:02:15,552
Goodness.

20
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:19,305
The guy she forced down our throats
like this has finally

21
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:20,890
revealed his true colors.

22
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:25,478
But now we have another problem
on our hands.

23
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:30,441
It'd be fine if Baek was the only one
who was publicly embarrassed by all this.

24
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:32,360
This mess affects all of us here.

25
00:02:32,902 --> 00:02:35,280
Our hospital's reputation
is now in danger.

26
00:02:35,363 --> 00:02:37,282
He made the hospital look unprofessional.

27
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:42,162
He emailed me asking for a budget increase
for the trauma department.

28
00:02:42,912 --> 00:02:45,582
- Budget increase?
- Yes! You know what he said?

29
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:48,793
Baek said if the hospital couldn't manage
to find the money,

30
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:50,587
he'd ask the minister directly.

31
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,255
His disrespect is outrageous!

32
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:54,340
I had no idea that…

33
00:02:55,633 --> 00:02:57,510
Oh, that rat bastard is just--

34
00:02:57,594 --> 00:03:01,556
I'm not happy with any of this, huh?
And the minister always takes his side.

35
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:04,184
'Cause we don't have a valid reason
to throw him out.

36
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:07,687
Well, we can't just
twiddle our thumbs like this either.

37
00:03:08,396 --> 00:03:10,607
Let's wait for the right opportunity, huh?

38
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:13,276
Baek thinks he's holding
all the cards right now.

39
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,529
But sooner or later,
he will screw up, you know.

40
00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:18,907
Mm… Mm-hmm.

41
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:20,742
Oh, excuse me.

42
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:22,493
An emergency.

43
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:28,291
Black Wings.

44
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:33,463
"Black Wings."

45
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:35,590
BLACK WINGS
PRIVATE MILITARY COMPANY

46
00:03:35,673 --> 00:03:38,134
{\an8}"The largest private military
company in the world."

47
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:41,221
{\an8}"Mainly focused on VIP protection
in conflict zones

48
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:44,349
{\an8}and combat operations,
including kidnapping rescue missions."

49
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:47,227
{\an8}"Their capabilities surpass
special forces units."

50
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:49,103
{\an8}"And due to their level of combat,

51
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:52,857
{\an8}all combat operations
must be accompanied by medics."

52
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,652
"Such medics are

53
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:59,405
trained to be deadly in their own right."

54
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:11,251
"Trained to be human weapons."

55
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:12,293
Wow.

56
00:04:14,462 --> 00:04:16,047
Wow. This is extraordinary.

57
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:24,722
Number One.

58
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:27,058
Yes, sir! At your service, sir!

59
00:04:27,141 --> 00:04:28,393
What are you doing?

60
00:04:28,476 --> 00:04:30,311
I wasn't doing anything! I swear!

61
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:32,563
You weren't? Well, why not?

62
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:35,942
You should be checking the vital signs
and I/O measurements of the ICU patients.

63
00:04:36,025 --> 00:04:39,445
And studying the papers I gave you.
So what do you mean you're doing nothing?

64
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:40,405
Why would you…

65
00:04:40,488 --> 00:04:43,074
- Uh, uh, uh…
- …waste time looking up things like this?

66
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:45,868
You're right! I'm sorry!

67
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:47,495
- Come on.
- I won't do it again, sir.

68
00:04:47,578 --> 00:04:50,206
That's good.
Best you just do what you're told.

69
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,878
Uh, by the way, Dr. Baek. Uh…

70
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:59,507
Uh… I am curious though.

71
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:03,594
I really don't have any ulterior motives.
Just I'm just curious about something.

72
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:04,554
Well, what?

73
00:05:05,054 --> 00:05:08,725
Well… going from
the Doctors for International Peace

74
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:12,228
to Black Wings is quite surprising.

75
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:14,564
I don't really understand it.

76
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:17,066
Ah!

77
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:21,487
You went somewhere more dangerous
since there's more trauma patients there.

78
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:23,197
- I guess that's why.
- I went for money.

79
00:05:24,365 --> 00:05:25,199
Huh?

80
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,160
They said they'd pay me a lot.

81
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:30,288
Ah.

82
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,498
{\an8}<i>Code Black. Code Black.</i>

83
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:35,043
{\an8}<i>All emergency medicine</i>
<i>and trauma center personnel.</i>

84
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:36,627
{\an8}<i>- To the trauma center.</i>
- Seriously?

85
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:37,545
<i>Code Black…</i>

86
00:05:37,628 --> 00:05:39,130
- That's meant for disasters.
- Run.

87
00:05:39,213 --> 00:05:41,674
<i>…medicine and trauma center personnel</i>
<i>to the trauma center.</i>

88
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:49,265
- <i>Dr. Baek.</i>
- Gangster. What's going on?

89
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:52,435
<i>They say it's</i>
<i>a 60-vehicle pile-up on Sowol Bridge.</i>

90
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:54,937
<i>It's really bad.</i>
<i>Probably cause of the fog.</i>

91
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:57,440
<i>Most of the vehicles,</i>
<i>including two tour buses,</i>

92
00:05:57,523 --> 00:05:59,442
<i>are being attended to on the bridge.</i>

93
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:01,694
<i>It's reported that four vehicles,</i>
<i>including a bus,</i>

94
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:03,279
<i>have fallen off the bridge.</i>

95
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:07,909
<i>Ambulances are coming in</i>
<i>as we speak. Hurry.</i>

96
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,246
Gonna be a lot of patients incoming.

97
00:06:13,956 --> 00:06:18,169
<i>Hurry! Patients fill up</i>
<i>level-3 hospitals in situations like this</i>

98
00:06:18,252 --> 00:06:21,172
<i>since transporting patients</i>
<i>to smaller hospitals could be fatal.</i>

99
00:06:21,255 --> 00:06:22,256
<i>Got it? Hurry.</i>

100
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:27,095
This way. Quickly! This way!

101
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:29,180
Get them to the treatment room!

102
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:32,350
Coming through. Let us pass, please.

103
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:34,852
This way. Hurry!

104
00:06:36,437 --> 00:06:37,480
Coming through.

105
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:44,278
- Wait.
- This way, please.

106
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:46,072
Hurry. Hurry!

107
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:48,199
- Get a central line in.
- Yes, Doctor.

108
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:51,452
We need every operating room we have!

109
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:52,412
Okay.

110
00:06:53,204 --> 00:06:54,914
Keep your eyes closed. Keep 'em closed!

111
00:06:56,999 --> 00:06:59,085
- Yes, hello?
- Gangster, call every last resident.

112
00:06:59,168 --> 00:07:01,546
Everybody's already here,
even emergency medicine interns.

113
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:03,047
Get every department!

114
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:05,216
- Especially from surgery!
- Yes, Dr. Baek.

115
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:06,926
Dr. Kim. This way!

116
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:09,303
I'm sending the patient
for tests.

117
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:11,222
Stay with me. Stay with me!

118
00:07:11,305 --> 00:07:13,224
Call orthopedics, please!

119
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:14,851
Dr. Baek.

120
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:17,854
Mr. An is transporting a patient
via helicopter right now.

121
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:26,571
- One, two, three.
- Okay. Lift.

122
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:29,907
It's not an open wound. Thank God.

123
00:07:30,491 --> 00:07:32,285
Gangster, notify orthopedics.

124
00:07:32,368 --> 00:07:33,369
Yes, Dr. Baek.

125
00:07:35,204 --> 00:07:37,748
- What? What are you doing?
- Hey, call Mr. An, would you?

126
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:41,169
What are you doing? We should go back.
The patient! The patient!

127
00:07:41,252 --> 00:07:44,005
Mr. An, can you hear me?
It's Baek Kang-hyuk.

128
00:07:44,088 --> 00:07:46,591
<i>Mr. An, can you hear me?</i>

129
00:07:46,674 --> 00:07:49,427
<i>Mr. An. It's Baek Kang-hyuk.</i>

130
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:52,972
Is that you, Dr. Baek?
It's chaos over here!

131
00:07:54,223 --> 00:07:56,726
<i>I heard there were vehicles</i>
<i>that fell off the bridge.</i>

132
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:59,312
<i>Have the rescue efforts begun there too?</i>

133
00:07:59,395 --> 00:08:02,398
Uh, no. We haven't begun operations
under the bridge.

134
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:07,528
We're having difficulties gaining access,
so we're preparing to rappel down now.

135
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:11,240
Thank you, Mr. An.

136
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:14,410
Should we be going in--

137
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,204
- We're going to the crash site.
- What?

138
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:18,998
The ones with really serious injuries
are down there! Let's go!

139
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:21,542
Hold on! Dr. Baek, wait.

140
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:23,711
But…

141
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:29,967
{\an8}<i>This morning, at 7:40 a.m.,</i>
<i>a major accident occurred…</i>

142
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:33,721
{\an8}The emergency room has
a maximum capacity to treat 40 patients.

143
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:36,390
We're currently treating 38 patients.

144
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:39,352
They'll go to the relevant departments
after initial assessments.

145
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:41,020
All right.

146
00:08:41,103 --> 00:08:44,440
Emergency medicine will really need to
pull their weight for this incident.

147
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:46,025
In the immediate aftermath now,

148
00:08:46,108 --> 00:08:48,277
we have to process
as many patients as possible.

149
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:50,488
That's the best way of resolving this. Mm.

150
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:56,869
Oh goodness.
That's a load off, isn't it? Huh?

151
00:08:56,953 --> 00:09:00,122
I was worried they'd try to bring
every last injured patient here.

152
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:02,833
And with that,
we'd have to pour so much money into it.

153
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:06,921
- It wouldn't even cover the electricity.
- Director, excuse me. Watch your language.

154
00:09:07,004 --> 00:09:09,465
'Cause if someone else were listening in,

155
00:09:10,174 --> 00:09:12,051
they would think
that I did this for money,

156
00:09:12,134 --> 00:09:15,638
that I called the disaster code
to avoid accepting trauma patients.

157
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:18,808
Oh, that's not what I meant at all, sir.

158
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:22,937
It's just that large-scale incidents
garner a lot of media attention,

159
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:24,939
so it wouldn't hurt to be cautious.

160
00:09:25,022 --> 00:09:27,066
Just imagine
Baek Kang-hyuk running around,

161
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:30,319
making a fuss like he's some kind of hero
trying to save everyone.

162
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:32,071
When he does well, he gets all the credit.

163
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:35,658
But one wrong move,
and our hospital is held responsible.

164
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:38,494
So we should
nip these problems in the bud,

165
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:39,954
No? Dr. Im agrees?

166
00:09:40,037 --> 00:09:41,664
Yes. Uh, Director Hong.

167
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:44,584
Right now, Dr. Baek… isn't with us.

168
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:45,585
Exactly.

169
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:48,296
Wait, what do you mean?

170
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:51,340
He should be treating patients.
Where'd he go?

171
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:54,510
Yes. Well, before he left,
I said exactly that.

172
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:57,722
He said emergency medicine should be able
to take care of this much, and…

173
00:09:57,805 --> 00:09:59,557
Ugh, so where the hell did he run off to?

174
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,601
Uh, he went to the crash site.
He flew out there.

175
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:07,982
He went there so he could
escort patients here on his own?

176
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:19,994
Dr. Baek. We've arrived.

177
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:22,622
Should we land on the bridge?

178
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:25,583
Or should we go down under the bridge?

179
00:10:28,377 --> 00:10:29,629
Captain.

180
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:32,256
- Go straight under the bridge now.
- Yes, Dr. Baek.

181
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:34,175
Whoa!

182
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:43,142
{\an8}Come this way.
This way. This way! Hurry. Hurry!

183
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:06,874
How's the situation?

184
00:11:06,957 --> 00:11:10,419
We were able to clear a path,
so ambulances are beginning to arrive now.

185
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:12,838
We're redirecting people
as soon as they're extracted.

186
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:15,132
No. Need to triage 'em first.

187
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:17,593
- We need all victims in one place.
- Okay.

188
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:20,096
Start with
the most critical patients?

189
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:22,473
We're not here to treat.
We're here to triage.

190
00:11:22,556 --> 00:11:25,393
No one here is authorized
to declare anyone dead.

191
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:28,479
Separate the patients we can save
from those we cannot.

192
00:11:28,562 --> 00:11:30,940
Start by triaging the conscious patients.

193
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:32,525
What about you?

194
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:37,530
I'll begin with the casualties.

195
00:11:37,613 --> 00:11:39,031
Don't let it get to you.

196
00:11:40,282 --> 00:11:41,158
Right.

197
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:49,875
Here. Over here. Over here.

198
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:59,009
Three, two, three.
One, two, three, four…

199
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:01,303
All right.

200
00:12:02,012 --> 00:12:05,516
From now on,
all victims must be assessed by us first.

201
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:08,644
Do not take any patients
to an ambulance before then.

202
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:11,814
So let's have all conscious patients
on the right

203
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:14,525
and unconscious patients on my left, okay?

204
00:12:14,608 --> 00:12:16,235
That means the dead as well.

205
00:12:16,318 --> 00:12:18,696
- Let's move quickly.
- Yes, sir!

206
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:19,947
Two, three, four…

207
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:21,407
- Dr. Baek.
- Move 'em here!

208
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:23,993
- Separate the patients.
- Have a defibrillator?

209
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:25,077
Yes. Over here.

210
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:33,419
Stop compressions now.

211
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:35,921
The man's dead.

212
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:42,511
We don't have time to waste.

213
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:45,431
Move on to the others. They need us now.

214
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:47,933
Right.

215
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,563
Some help over here.

216
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:56,108
{\an8}Let's move the patients
over here.

217
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:58,778
{\an8}UNKNOWN MALE
CONDITION: DECEASED

218
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:15,795
Here. This way. Quick, quickly.

219
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:17,838
Put them down over here. Over here.

220
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:27,223
Well, we need
a plan of action, don't we?

221
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:36,315
Minister, Dr. Baek is on site.
I've had word that he's triaging patients.

222
00:13:36,398 --> 00:13:37,608
- Dr. Baek?
- Yes, ma'am.

223
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:40,486
<i>All emergency rooms</i>
<i>able to accept patients</i>

224
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:41,904
<i>are currently filled up.</i>

225
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:44,698
{\an8}- Brother!
- It's all right. You're all right.

226
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:48,994
My brother.

227
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:52,998
Help me.

228
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:59,338
My brother
fell off the bridge too.

229
00:13:59,421 --> 00:14:01,966
We held onto each other.

230
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:03,968
All right. Don't worry.

231
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:06,262
I'll rescue your brother too.

232
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:08,514
So just hold on a little while.

233
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:10,349
Okay.

234
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:13,644
Hurry. Over this way.
This way, this way.

235
00:14:15,437 --> 00:14:17,731
Dr. Baek! Take a look at this one.

236
00:14:21,777 --> 00:14:24,488
{\an8}He's breathing and has a pulse,
but he's unconscious.

237
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:27,366
{\an8}Looks like he took a broken pipe
to his stomach during the fall.

238
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:30,369
There was so much bleeding.
We decided to cut the pipe.

239
00:14:30,452 --> 00:14:31,620
All right, good call.

240
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:34,039
Get thread and a suture kit.

241
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:35,541
- A number two thread.
- Right.

242
00:14:35,624 --> 00:14:37,376
Move aside, please.
Coming through.

243
00:14:38,502 --> 00:14:39,962
- Here.
- Hold on.

244
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:46,135
I got it! I'll bring it with me.

245
00:14:47,511 --> 00:14:50,848
Uh, Dr. Baek,
that suture is really deep, isn't it?

246
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:54,018
We need to control the bleeding first.
Come on, pay attention.

247
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:57,521
You know how to treat an impaled patient?

248
00:14:57,605 --> 00:14:59,273
You make a median incision.

249
00:14:59,356 --> 00:15:01,150
You control the bleeding first.

250
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:02,776
After that, remove this.

251
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,278
Makes sense, yeah.

252
00:15:06,363 --> 00:15:07,197
Wait now?

253
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:09,783
Take this patient in the helicopter
and start surgery.

254
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:11,535
I'll catch up with you later.

255
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:16,040
Um, can't I do the triaging, Dr. Baek?

256
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:21,962
Are you saying… you can determine
whether a patient will live?

257
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:24,381
No, it's not that.
I'm just not confident enough that I--

258
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:25,633
You can do this.

259
00:15:26,383 --> 00:15:28,385
Trust me. I believe in you.
You've got this.

260
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:33,515
- You all right?
- Move him here.

261
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:34,975
This patient's gonna live.

262
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:37,436
Number One, take it from here.

263
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:38,520
All right?

264
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:41,023
Yes.

265
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:43,359
Yes, sir.

266
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:02,544
All right.
Careful, careful, Nurse Jang-mi.

267
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:05,881
Nurse Jang-mi, is the room ready?

268
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:08,133
Standing by. Are we waiting for Dr. Baek?

269
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:10,260
He's still at the crash site.
Let's begin the surgery.

270
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:11,720
Come on, let's get going.

271
00:16:25,901 --> 00:16:27,319
<i>You can do this.</i>

272
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:30,239
<i>Trust me. I believe in you.</i>
<i>You've got this.</i>

273
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:45,337
Start with a median incision.

274
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:46,922
Control the bleeding first.

275
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:49,508
Blood pressure. I can do this.

276
00:16:50,467 --> 00:16:51,635
Doctor.

277
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:53,303
Focus.

278
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:55,931
You're the lead surgeon here.

279
00:16:56,598 --> 00:16:59,518
If the lead surgeon loses focus,
it affects the whole team.

280
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:09,528
Let's

281
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:11,739
begin the surgery.

282
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:13,949
Scalpel.

283
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:23,125
{\an8}NAME: LEE CHANG-HUN, GENDER: MALE
PENETRATING WOUND

284
00:17:31,258 --> 00:17:33,677
{\an8}UNKNOWN FEMALE
CONDITION: IMMEDIATE

285
00:17:35,512 --> 00:17:37,431
{\an8}Open fracture, so clean it carefully.

286
00:17:37,514 --> 00:17:38,640
{\an8}Yes, sir.

287
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:45,814
We're giving you painkillers.
You'll feel better soon.

288
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:52,988
Dr. Baek,
I… I found this on the patient.

289
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:56,533
She's carrying insulin.
That means she's diabetic.

290
00:17:57,743 --> 00:17:58,577
What do we do?

291
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:04,750
We need to transport her right now.

292
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:06,418
Which hospital should we go to?

293
00:18:08,128 --> 00:18:09,505
Hankuk University Hospital.

294
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:10,506
Okay.

295
00:18:16,136 --> 00:18:17,221
Dr. Baek.

296
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:20,557
You should take a look
at this patient too.

297
00:18:23,977 --> 00:18:25,437
He's the last survivor.

298
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:27,731
All other triaged patients
have been transported.

299
00:18:32,861 --> 00:18:35,614
The bleeding is so severe.
Do you think he has a chance?

300
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:41,411
Brother!

301
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:44,414
Please save my brother.

302
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:47,042
{\an8}Help him.

303
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:52,422
{\an8}NAME: CHO SEOK-JUN, GENDER: MALE
CONDITION: IMMEDIATE

304
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:56,009
{\an8}We're heading to the hospital
with the open fracture patient.

305
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:57,386
{\an8}Are you going with us?

306
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:00,639
Shouldn't you operate
on the patient

307
00:19:00,722 --> 00:19:02,474
who has a better chance of surviving?

308
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:04,643
- This patient can go to a different--
- No.

309
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:06,603
Only I can save this patient.

310
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:11,441
What about that other patient?

311
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:13,902
And the one you sent to
Hankuk University Hospital.

312
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:15,654
He's in serious condition as well.

313
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:30,210
They're all going to the same hospital.

314
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:34,339
I'm going to save… all three.

315
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:40,220
Oh my. That smells delicious.

316
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:44,683
Mm-mm.
I don't wanna eat anymore. I'm full.

317
00:19:44,766 --> 00:19:47,561
Oh, come on.
We can't let this food go to waste.

318
00:19:47,644 --> 00:19:49,354
You'll feel better. Just a moment…

319
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:51,398
JERK DOCTOR BAEK KANG-HYUK

320
00:19:51,481 --> 00:19:53,275
Oh, who do we have here?

321
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:55,694
Our savior, Dr. Baek Kang-hyuk.
How are you?

322
00:19:55,777 --> 00:19:57,529
<i>I have a patient with an open fracture.</i>

323
00:19:57,613 --> 00:19:58,947
<i>- I need help!</i>
- You need help?

324
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:02,034
Who's available right now? I don't know.

325
00:20:02,117 --> 00:20:03,744
An attending orthopedic surgeon?

326
00:20:03,827 --> 00:20:05,537
<i>He's probably in surgery.</i>
<i>Maybe a resident.</i>

327
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:06,914
It can't be a resident. No way!

328
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:09,124
<i>If not a resident,</i>
<i>who else could I enlist?</i>

329
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:11,001
<i>- An attending!</i>
- I don't know.

330
00:20:11,084 --> 00:20:13,212
This is really serious.
Please help me out!

331
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:14,546
<i>All right.</i>

332
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:18,675
- I understand.
<i>- You get ready to perform surgery too.</i>

333
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:20,510
What? Now?

334
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:22,095
Yes. Please go to the OR.

335
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:23,847
<i>I'm a colorectal surgeon.</i>

336
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:25,682
And I'm rusty with a scalpel.

337
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:27,226
I'm not messing around.

338
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:29,019
Please get ready.

339
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:32,814
Hey! Dr. Baek.

340
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:38,779
Is he serious?
Does he always have to hang up first?

341
00:20:40,113 --> 00:20:41,406
- What is it?
- Hmm?

342
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:42,491
Tell me.

343
00:20:43,992 --> 00:20:44,993
Well,

344
00:20:46,036 --> 00:20:48,497
they're short on staff
and want me in the OR.

345
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:49,539
Mm.

346
00:20:49,623 --> 00:20:51,416
I don't think I belong in there.

347
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,709
I think you should go.

348
00:20:52,793 --> 00:20:54,628
Why do you think I went to medical school?

349
00:20:54,711 --> 00:20:57,297
It's 'cause my dad looked so cool
with a scalpel in his hand.

350
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:00,968
Really?

351
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:04,888
SURGERY IN PROGRESS

352
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:05,973
Oh, oh, are you done?

353
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:07,683
- I said, I'm not doing it.
- How'd it go?

354
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:09,142
Come on, don't be like that.

355
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:10,519
I haven't had time to eat today.

356
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:12,479
You know how many surgeries
I've performed?

357
00:21:12,562 --> 00:21:14,064
Oh God. Come on.

358
00:21:14,147 --> 00:21:16,441
Of course, I know. Come on, Doctor. Huh?

359
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:18,652
We have to save the patient, right?

360
00:21:18,735 --> 00:21:20,404
And they have an open fracture.

361
00:21:20,487 --> 00:21:22,531
You know you're the only one
who can do this.

362
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:24,408
So help me. Help me out here. Okay?

363
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:25,909
Come on. I'll be over there.

364
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:29,663
Huh? What's gotten into him lately?

365
00:21:34,835 --> 00:21:36,461
This is anesthesiology.

366
00:21:37,754 --> 00:21:39,965
- Oh…
- What is it? What?

367
00:21:40,048 --> 00:21:41,341
Emergency surgery.

368
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:43,927
Tell them I'm not here.
I'm not here. I'm not here.

369
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:46,430
Ah, that's unfortunate. We're all full.

370
00:21:46,513 --> 00:21:48,056
So many surgeries scheduled today.

371
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,182
Which OR is it?

372
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:55,022
All right. Dr. Park Gyeong-won
just asked which OR it is.

373
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:56,982
Right. Understood.

374
00:21:58,483 --> 00:21:59,776
Emergency OR.

375
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:06,325
Hey, Park Gyeong. Aren't you annoyed?

376
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:09,202
Our schedules are running late.
And they throw this on us?

377
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:11,663
Like you said, it's an emergency.
Of course it's dumped on us.

378
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:12,873
What's that?

379
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:16,418
Aren't we required by law
to have anesthesiologists

380
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:17,961
on standby for emergencies?

381
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:20,630
And yet, we still schedule everyone
ahead of time.

382
00:22:20,714 --> 00:22:22,716
Isn't that the real problem around here?

383
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:25,302
What did you say?
You little punk.

384
00:22:25,385 --> 00:22:26,386
Hey, get over here.

385
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:27,596
Hey, Park Gyeong!

386
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:34,978
<i>All emergency medicine</i>
<i>and trauma center personnel…</i>

387
00:22:35,062 --> 00:22:35,979
Good morning, Dr. Ma.

388
00:22:37,731 --> 00:22:41,109
If you're headed this way,
that has to mean it's for trauma surgery?

389
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:42,903
Yes.

390
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:44,946
Don't go.

391
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:48,533
Why would you say that?

392
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:51,620
They've been trying to hire
a full-time anesthesiologist.

393
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:53,622
No one's applied in two years.

394
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:58,835
Don't give false hope to the people
in the trauma department.

395
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:03,673
I'll just find someone else
to go to the OR.

396
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:19,940
Uh, Dr. Baek!

397
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,192
- Anesthesiology?
- They're not here yet.

398
00:23:22,275 --> 00:23:23,110
Ah shit.

399
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:24,611
One, two, three.

400
00:23:28,865 --> 00:23:32,619
{\an8}NAME: CHO SEOK-JUN, GENDER: MALE
UPPER/LOWER ABDOMINAL RUPTURE

401
00:23:36,331 --> 00:23:37,416
Dr. Baek.

402
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:40,168
Oh, Dr. Han.
Take care of the lower abdomen.

403
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:41,920
You want me
to perform surgery now?

404
00:23:42,003 --> 00:23:44,548
You're a colorectal surgeon.
You do plenty of rectal surgeries.

405
00:23:44,631 --> 00:23:46,716
Gosh.
This looks pretty complicated.

406
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,177
- Get your gown on. Quickly.
- Right, right. Okay.

407
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:52,681
Jesus! Where's the anesthesiologist?

408
00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:54,599
Dr. Baek,
I'll start with propofol.

409
00:23:54,683 --> 00:23:55,934
Okay. Hurry, hurry.

410
00:24:04,317 --> 00:24:05,402
Propofol is in.

411
00:24:05,485 --> 00:24:08,113
Hold on. What should I do first?

412
00:24:08,196 --> 00:24:10,991
I've got my index and middle finger
compressing the area.

413
00:24:11,074 --> 00:24:13,285
As well as the lower part
of the palm of my hand.

414
00:24:13,368 --> 00:24:14,870
Right. Okay, like this.

415
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:16,872
{\an8}Stay like this
until I wash my hands.

416
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:19,458
{\an8}- Three minutes maximum. Three minutes.
- Gosh, all right.

417
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:21,042
{\an8}- Three minutes.
- Whoa! Whoa! Ah! Ah!

418
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:22,586
{\an8}Ah! Hurry, hurry! Ah!

419
00:24:22,669 --> 00:24:24,629
Hey, hurry up! Come back!

420
00:24:25,255 --> 00:24:26,756
Ah! Whoa!

421
00:24:28,425 --> 00:24:31,052
Hang on for just a second.
Just a second.

422
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:32,762
Ah! My hands are slipping here!

423
00:24:32,846 --> 00:24:35,724
- Please. Shit.
- Come on! Where are you?

424
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:38,810
Hurry up. His blood pressure is dropping.
It's dropping!

425
00:24:39,686 --> 00:24:42,063
What are you doing?
I just needed three minutes.

426
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:45,859
- Is that so hard? You've done this before!
- Just hurry up and do something!

427
00:24:45,942 --> 00:24:47,194
One, two.

428
00:24:47,277 --> 00:24:49,571
Right. Okay. Hold tight. Scalpel.

429
00:24:49,654 --> 00:24:50,614
Right here.

430
00:24:50,697 --> 00:24:53,700
- I'm making the incision. Hold him still.
- Okay. I've got it.

431
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:02,834
Despite the nature of the accident,
in which several vehicles

432
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:05,462
fell off the Bukhansan Bridge,
there were very few casualties.

433
00:25:05,545 --> 00:25:08,632
This was due to the medical professionals
who arrived very early on,

434
00:25:08,715 --> 00:25:10,926
ensuring that the golden hour
was leveraged effectively.

435
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:12,928
Minister of Health and Welfare,
Kang Myeong-hui,

436
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:15,180
has called for hospitals
where patients were transferred

437
00:25:15,263 --> 00:25:17,224
to focus their efforts
on treating those patients.

438
00:25:17,307 --> 00:25:20,101
I am in front of
Hankuk National University Hospital.

439
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:22,729
There are three trauma patients
receiving emergency surgery

440
00:25:22,812 --> 00:25:24,606
for very serious injuries here.

441
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:29,486
{\an8}<i>These patients were transferred</i>
<i>on the advice of Dr. Baek Kang-hyuk</i>

442
00:25:29,569 --> 00:25:31,404
{\an8}<i>who was at the crash site himself.</i>

443
00:25:31,488 --> 00:25:35,116
{\an8}<i>It is understood that all three patients</i>
<i>are in very critical condition.</i>

444
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:43,166
Suture.

445
00:25:59,933 --> 00:26:03,103
Once we control the bleeding,
we'll start on the spleen in the abdomen.

446
00:26:04,437 --> 00:26:05,355
All right.

447
00:26:06,523 --> 00:26:08,775
Come on.
Why are you so damn slow? Hurry it up!

448
00:26:08,858 --> 00:26:10,860
I'm doing the best I can, Doctor.

449
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:13,780
I know you're doing your best.

450
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:16,658
Just try harder.

451
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:18,285
Damn it.

452
00:26:18,368 --> 00:26:20,078
Why are you in such a rush?

453
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:22,414
Because I'm a little busy.

454
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:28,878
{\an8}We've controlled the bleeding.
Now removing the pipe.

455
00:26:28,962 --> 00:26:34,134
{\an8}NAME: LEE CHANG-HUN, GENDER: MALE
PENETRATING WOUND, PIPE REMOVAL

456
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:51,693
<i>I have to join Number One</i>
<i>as soon as possible, so I need to hurry.</i>

457
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,570
The spleen is stitched up.

458
00:26:53,653 --> 00:26:54,946
- Cut.
- Okay.

459
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:57,073
What? You're already done?

460
00:26:57,157 --> 00:26:59,159
We've dealt with
the most urgent part.

461
00:26:59,242 --> 00:27:01,661
- Let's start on the lower abdomen.
- Understood, Doc--

462
00:27:01,745 --> 00:27:03,913
Listen to me.
I'm talking like a resident.

463
00:27:03,997 --> 00:27:05,915
Have you controlled
all the bleeds?

464
00:27:05,999 --> 00:27:08,460
No. Still blood coming
from inside the retroperitoneum.

465
00:27:08,543 --> 00:27:10,462
Damn it.
I don't have time for this.

466
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:12,172
What?

467
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:14,007
What's this?

468
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:16,551
Can I keep going? Do you think
all this bleeding is all right?

469
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:20,430
I think that the adrenal gland
has been completely destroyed.

470
00:27:23,099 --> 00:27:25,435
- What is it?
- His heart rate is climbing.

471
00:27:25,518 --> 00:27:27,270
What do we do? Dr. Baek.

472
00:27:27,354 --> 00:27:28,938
ABP 160.

473
00:27:29,022 --> 00:27:31,608
- Shit! Ah, damn it.
- 180.

474
00:27:31,691 --> 00:27:33,860
What is going on here?
Is it the adrenal glands?

475
00:27:33,943 --> 00:27:36,613
Think this patient has cancer.
His lymphatics are leaking.

476
00:27:36,696 --> 00:27:38,031
Huh? Lymphatics?

477
00:27:38,114 --> 00:27:40,367
Hey, hey, hey!
This is bad. This is really bad.

478
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:42,035
- Do something!
- Forceps.

479
00:27:42,118 --> 00:27:43,870
ABP 190. 200.

480
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:46,289
Hey! What's his BP again?

481
00:27:46,373 --> 00:27:49,376
Hey, there's a crazy amount of bleeding
in his lower abdomen.

482
00:27:49,459 --> 00:27:51,294
Hey, this… What's going on down there?

483
00:27:51,378 --> 00:27:54,631
He's going from sinus rhythm
to arrhythmia. Tachycardia.

484
00:27:54,714 --> 00:27:57,967
What is his BP right now?
You sure it's all right to keep going?

485
00:27:58,051 --> 00:27:59,427
- Tie.
- Tie.

486
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:03,723
{\an8}I'm pushing beta-blockers.

487
00:28:04,307 --> 00:28:05,725
{\an8}Start by controlling the bleeding.

488
00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:06,935
Dr. Baek.

489
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:08,853
Bovie. Forceps. Quickly.

490
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:10,814
Dr. Baek! Do something!

491
00:28:10,897 --> 00:28:12,232
Just hold on.

492
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:15,819
- I'm removing the adrenal gland itself.
- What?

493
00:28:15,902 --> 00:28:17,320
Are you crazy? Wait!

494
00:28:17,904 --> 00:28:20,198
This could end very badly. Don't do that!

495
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:24,035
Dr. Baek. Think this through!
I'm begging you!

496
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:27,664
If you slip up while removing
the adrenal gland… Dr. Baek.

497
00:28:27,747 --> 00:28:29,040
Hey, Dr. Baek.

498
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:33,044
Wait.

499
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:37,090
It's done?

500
00:28:37,173 --> 00:28:38,341
Blood pressure?

501
00:28:39,509 --> 00:28:41,177
ABP 180. Coming down slowly.

502
00:28:42,178 --> 00:28:44,597
- How much beta-blockers has he had?
- Five mg.

503
00:28:44,681 --> 00:28:46,891
It's been 30 seconds
since we put the fluids at full load.

504
00:28:46,975 --> 00:28:49,269
I'll keep it around 500
for the next ten minutes.

505
00:28:49,352 --> 00:28:50,645
All right, perfect.

506
00:28:51,146 --> 00:28:52,814
Time to finish up.

507
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:56,067
Yes. Let's stitch it up.

508
00:28:56,693 --> 00:28:59,738
No. You finish it yourself.
I need to check on Number One.

509
00:29:00,822 --> 00:29:02,490
What?
You want me to do this alone?

510
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:04,242
His vital signs
have stabilized.

511
00:29:04,325 --> 00:29:06,369
Get help from Dr. Park for the rest of it.

512
00:29:06,953 --> 00:29:08,329
This patient's alive

513
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:10,915
in part because of him.

514
00:29:16,504 --> 00:29:18,673
You're just leaving?

515
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:23,136
It's Baek Kang-hyuk.
How is the surgery going so far?

516
00:29:23,803 --> 00:29:25,764
We're doing the best we
can right now, but…

517
00:29:25,847 --> 00:29:28,057
Uh… He's bleeding!
Gauze, please.

518
00:29:28,141 --> 00:29:29,726
Change out the unit of blood!

519
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:33,229
- Raise the suction, please.
<i>- Hello?</i>

520
00:29:33,313 --> 00:29:35,023
Hey. Hey!

521
00:29:35,815 --> 00:29:38,318
Ah shit. Why would she hang up like that?

522
00:29:42,864 --> 00:29:45,408
- It's still coming out. Push!
- Yes, yes, Doctor.

523
00:29:45,492 --> 00:29:47,702
I got it. Out, out, out, out.

524
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:49,621
- Okay. Right…
- Right-angle.

525
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:51,790
Yes.

526
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:57,253
And the, uh…

527
00:29:58,171 --> 00:29:59,881
Number three sutures, right?

528
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:03,384
Thank you.

529
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:16,022
How's the bleeding?

530
00:30:16,105 --> 00:30:17,023
Uh…

531
00:30:17,774 --> 00:30:19,400
Oh, Dr. Baek.

532
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:21,903
Move your hand.
I can't see anything on-screen.

533
00:30:21,986 --> 00:30:24,405
Look at that.
You're still struggling in the mesentery.

534
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:27,534
It's just that
this was split in half, so…

535
00:30:27,617 --> 00:30:30,620
You should've cauterized
all the cuts to get through.

536
00:30:32,789 --> 00:30:35,124
He's bleeding out
'cause you've done the ties like that.

537
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:38,169
You need to completely separate
the fat and the arteries.

538
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:40,296
I… I was in such a rush that…

539
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:44,175
- Go to your place.
- Huh?

540
00:30:53,893 --> 00:30:55,019
Dissector.

541
00:30:56,938 --> 00:30:57,772
Number One.

542
00:30:58,356 --> 00:30:59,983
- Yes?
- Watch closely.

543
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:03,695
When you get through the fatty tissue
and see the blood vessels,

544
00:31:04,195 --> 00:31:07,323
you need to tie it off like this
within one centimeter of the wound.

545
00:31:07,407 --> 00:31:08,366
Yes, Doctor.

546
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,334
{\an8}NAME: JANG JI-U,
GENDER: FEMALE OPEN TIBIA FRACTURE

547
00:31:18,418 --> 00:31:19,586
Suction.

548
00:31:23,298 --> 00:31:25,341
{\an8}Dr. Jung,
the EKG is slowing down.

549
00:31:27,844 --> 00:31:29,679
Why's it slowing down?

550
00:31:29,762 --> 00:31:32,807
Have epi and atropine ready,
and bring out the defibrillator now.

551
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:34,684
{\an8}- Call Code Blue. Quickly!
- Yes, Doctor!

552
00:31:34,767 --> 00:31:37,145
{\an8}REQUESTING RESUSCITATION TEAM

<i>Code Blue. Code Blue.</i>
<i>Main building OR 25.</i>

554
00:31:40,189 --> 00:31:43,776
Number One, retie the areas
you worked on earlier and look further in.

555
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:45,194
If it looks all right,

556
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:47,280
cauterize all the other bleeds
and close up.

557
00:31:47,363 --> 00:31:49,782
Dr. Baek, where are you going?

558
00:31:51,075 --> 00:31:52,118
Where are you going?

559
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:56,789
The right leg's fine.
We controlled the bleeding early on.

560
00:31:56,873 --> 00:31:58,499
What's the problem, huh?

561
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,545
<i>Code Blue. Code Blue.</i>
<i>Main building OR 25.</i>

00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:03,838

563
00:32:08,468 --> 00:32:11,095
- Back to normal rhythm.
- Huh?

564
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:13,097
Hey, she's back. Get down, get down.

565
00:32:16,976 --> 00:32:17,977
Who's that?

566
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:19,437
Baek Kang-hyuk?

567
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,814
Yes. How's the patient?

568
00:32:21,898 --> 00:32:23,900
We've set the ventilator
to 11 breaths per minute,

569
00:32:23,983 --> 00:32:27,487
{\an8}but the gas exchange isn't happening.
Saturation has dropped to 60.

570
00:32:28,529 --> 00:32:30,531
No preexisting conditions
other than diabetes?

571
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:31,449
That's right.

572
00:32:31,532 --> 00:32:33,868
{\an8}Put her on full oxygen
and start loading heparin.

573
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:34,994
{\an8}Heparin?

574
00:32:35,078 --> 00:32:37,038
{\an8}Don't question it. Just do it.

575
00:32:37,121 --> 00:32:38,539
Yes, sir.

576
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:41,084
Uh, Dr. Baek,
could you explain what's going on?

577
00:32:41,918 --> 00:32:44,963
What could happen
when a fracture and vascular injury happen

578
00:32:45,046 --> 00:32:46,172
at the same time?

579
00:32:46,255 --> 00:32:47,715
Bones are full of fat, right?

580
00:32:48,216 --> 00:32:51,636
So when bones break,
the fat flows into the veins.

581
00:32:51,719 --> 00:32:53,012
That's right.

582
00:32:53,096 --> 00:32:56,349
Through the right atrium and ventricle,
blocking up the pulmonary artery.

583
00:32:56,432 --> 00:32:58,476
It's a pulmonary embolism.

584
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:00,311
Yes, as you're well aware.

585
00:33:00,395 --> 00:33:01,521
That's right.

586
00:33:04,482 --> 00:33:05,984
Heparin is in, Doctor.

587
00:33:06,859 --> 00:33:08,528
Saturation is increasing.

588
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:12,156
She's over the first hurdle.
I'll take care of the left leg.

589
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,534
- Redo the draping.
- Yes, sir.

590
00:33:14,617 --> 00:33:17,412
An open fracture surgery
can't be performed by just anyone.

591
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:20,456
Exactly.

592
00:33:21,916 --> 00:33:23,459
That's why I said I'd do it.

593
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:38,641
Dr. Jae-won.

594
00:33:38,725 --> 00:33:39,684
Hmm?

595
00:33:40,268 --> 00:33:43,354
Don't get down on yourself.
He's just very particular, is all.

596
00:33:44,564 --> 00:33:47,483
Still, it's the first patient
he's entrusted to me.

597
00:33:49,736 --> 00:33:52,238
Why bother being a fellow
if you're good from the start?

598
00:33:55,575 --> 00:33:56,534
I don't know.

599
00:33:58,703 --> 00:34:01,748
Think of how much bleeding
there was at first. Ugh.

600
00:34:01,831 --> 00:34:03,916
We barely made it
with four units of blood.

601
00:34:06,002 --> 00:34:09,172
I honestly wasn't even sure
whether the patient would still be alive

602
00:34:09,255 --> 00:34:10,965
by the time Dr. Baek got here.

603
00:34:12,091 --> 00:34:13,551
But he is alive.

604
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:15,428
You did well.

605
00:34:20,349 --> 00:34:21,267
Thank you.

606
00:34:22,977 --> 00:34:26,564
{\an8}<i>Although this was a major accident,</i>
<i>the casualty rate was relatively low</i>

607
00:34:26,647 --> 00:34:28,608

611
00:34:40,203 --> 00:34:41,913
Uh, seriously, come on.

612
00:34:42,747 --> 00:34:44,916
How are we going to deal with this now?

613
00:34:44,999 --> 00:34:46,459
- It's driving me crazy.
- What is it?

614
00:34:46,542 --> 00:34:48,211
Director Hong! Outside the OR, there's--

615
00:34:48,294 --> 00:34:51,506
What is the OR status of
the Sowol Bridge trauma patients?

616
00:34:52,381 --> 00:34:54,258
I'm… not entirely sure.

617
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:55,968
Are you kidding me?

618
00:34:56,052 --> 00:34:59,138
You're supposed to know these things!
His patients are your responsibility!

619
00:34:59,222 --> 00:35:03,017
Actually, Dr. Baek is
treating the patients, and we…

620
00:35:03,684 --> 00:35:05,186
we take more of a supporting role.

621
00:35:05,269 --> 00:35:06,687
But outside the emergency room--

622
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:10,233
Hey, why don't you figure out
what's going on with Dr. Baek?

623
00:35:10,316 --> 00:35:13,069
If Dr. Baek is overseeing all this,
and he screws up,

624
00:35:13,152 --> 00:35:15,988
our hospital's reputation
is finished, yeah?

625
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:19,075
Huh?

626
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:26,332
What the…

627
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:30,461
It's only been three hours
since the patients arrived,

628
00:35:30,545 --> 00:35:32,130
and he's already leaving?

629
00:35:34,715 --> 00:35:35,842
Table death?

630
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:38,636
You mean, they… they… they died?

631
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:40,179
All three died?

632
00:35:41,097 --> 00:35:42,140
Oh God.

633
00:35:42,223 --> 00:35:43,474
- Oh.
- Oh God! Help me!

634
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:44,976
Are you okay, Director Hong?

635
00:35:46,352 --> 00:35:48,020
Oh. Hello there.

636
00:35:49,313 --> 00:35:50,273
Baek Kang.

637
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:52,483
Get back here right now!

638
00:35:53,401 --> 00:35:55,528
The hell? Why, that son of a…

639
00:35:55,611 --> 00:35:57,822
Director Hong, hold on.
Wait, just wait.

640
00:35:57,905 --> 00:36:00,449
- Stop right there! Director Hong, stop!
- Baek Kang-hyuk.

641
00:36:01,742 --> 00:36:02,660
Bastard!

642
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:09,667
Hey, you two. Please get away.

643
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:11,586
- Are you serious--
- Director Hong, wait.

644
00:36:14,213 --> 00:36:15,256
What is all this?

645
00:36:15,339 --> 00:36:18,134
Journalists. They're waiting
for Dr. Baek to get out of surgery.

646
00:36:18,217 --> 00:36:19,177
Why?

647
00:36:19,969 --> 00:36:22,180
Sowol Bridge. The accident.

648
00:36:23,055 --> 00:36:26,434
He's about to pronounce
those patients dead in front of everyone!

649
00:36:26,934 --> 00:36:28,102
He wouldn't, would he?

650
00:36:28,603 --> 00:36:29,854
The hell is he doing?

651
00:36:29,937 --> 00:36:32,899
- What's the status of the patients?
- Give a statement about the progress…

652
00:36:32,982 --> 00:36:35,651
Everyone, your attention, please.

653
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:39,238
Those three who were involved
in the accident

654
00:36:39,322 --> 00:36:41,032
and who suffered severe trauma

655
00:36:42,074 --> 00:36:43,034
will all

656
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,786
make full recoveries.

657
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:47,413
- Wow!
- Look this way.

658
00:36:47,496 --> 00:36:49,957
- Sir?
- This guy is really incredible!

659
00:36:53,961 --> 00:36:55,213
I wasn't alone.

660
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:01,302
It required some teamwork.

661
00:37:02,136 --> 00:37:03,012
Huh?

662
00:37:03,596 --> 00:37:05,348
This is Dr. Yang Jae-won.

663
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:09,685
Without him, it's a fact
those patients would not have survived.

664
00:37:11,354 --> 00:37:14,232
- Yang Jae-won. Look this way.
- Stand up straight.

665
00:37:14,315 --> 00:37:15,650
Yes, Dr. Baek.

666

<i>Dr. Baek Kang-hyuk</i>
<i>of Hankuk National University Hospital</i>

667
00:37:22,949 --> 00:37:26,577
<i>has reported that all surgeries of</i>
<i>the victims of the Sowol Bridge accident</i>

668
00:37:26,661 --> 00:37:27,536
<i>were a success.</i>

669
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:30,081
<i>- And, with that, Dr. Baek…</i>
- That's amazing.

In addition to Dr. Yang Jae-won here,

672
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:38,798
there are so many nurses
who work tirelessly along with our staff

673
00:37:38,881 --> 00:37:40,508
to keep this hospital running.

674
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:42,718
One nurse, in particular,

675
00:37:42,802 --> 00:37:44,303
deserves special credit.

676
00:37:44,971 --> 00:37:46,264
I would like to thank

677
00:37:47,848 --> 00:37:49,976

00:38:10,162 --> 00:38:12,498
despite the difficult circumstances
of today

681
00:38:12,581 --> 00:38:14,292

{\an8}<i>Dr. Park Gyeong-won of anesthesiology.</i>

686
00:38:28,889 --> 00:38:29,849
{\an8}<i>To you,</i>

687
00:38:30,766 --> 00:38:32,643
<i>I extend my deepest gratitude.</i>

688
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:36,022
The trauma center is a collective effort.

689
00:38:36,105 --> 00:38:39,775
Situations like today
would've been impossible if I were alone.

690
00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:43,571
But fortunately, we came together.

691
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:47,533
Please. If I could make just one request.

692
00:38:48,034 --> 00:38:51,078
<i>It's that you continue to show</i>
<i>your support for the work we do.</i>

693
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:53,956
<i>Your support will help us save</i>
<i>even more lives.</i>

694
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:55,708
<i>Who knows?</i>

695
00:38:55,791 --> 00:38:58,127
<i>Some of you may suffer injuries</i>
<i>in the future,</i>

696
00:38:58,210 --> 00:38:59,712
<i>but we'll be there to help.</i>

697
00:39:00,463 --> 00:39:04,258
<i>We at Hankuk National University Hospital</i>
<i>will not rest on our laurels.</i>

698
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:08,554
<i>We intend to become the trauma center</i>
<i>that this nation truly deserves.</i>

699
00:39:09,221 --> 00:39:12,892
And to that end, our first step
will be to increase our capacity,

700
00:39:12,975 --> 00:39:15,603
to secure high-quality
trauma surgery specialists

701
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:17,313
and medical staff as well.

702
00:39:19,732 --> 00:39:20,608
Smile.

703
00:39:22,276 --> 00:39:24,153
- Oh jeez.
- He's having the time of his life.

704
00:39:24,236 --> 00:39:27,198
Do you really mean what you're saying? Uh…

705
00:39:27,782 --> 00:39:30,910
Absolutely. It's time for us to expand.

706
00:39:30,993 --> 00:39:33,871
- Is he done yet?
- Oh, Director Hong.

707
00:39:37,083 --> 00:39:39,043
Our hospital's trauma center

708
00:39:39,126 --> 00:39:41,420
is doing its best
with insufficient funding.

709
00:39:41,504 --> 00:39:43,547
So this is what I'm proposing.

710
00:39:44,173 --> 00:39:48,177
We need additional funding
to strengthen our department.

711
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:50,054
Well, right. No, no, no…

712
00:39:50,137 --> 00:39:52,473
Could you please
give us a few words?

713
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:55,810
Well, uh… Oh, right. Well, uh…

714
00:39:56,602 --> 00:39:58,479
Director Hong, look this way.

715
00:39:58,562 --> 00:40:00,773
Unfortunately,
that's outside my authority, Doctor.

716
00:40:01,357 --> 00:40:03,109
The hospital director decides that.

717
00:40:03,192 --> 00:40:04,777
Hmm. I thought so.

718
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:07,071
Director Choi Jo-eun.

719
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:09,156
You're watching right now.

720
00:40:09,698 --> 00:40:11,200
Please. Would you think about it?

721
00:40:12,952 --> 00:40:14,036
<i>Smile.</i>

722
00:40:15,204 --> 00:40:16,539
Baek Kang-hyuk.

723
00:40:17,623 --> 00:40:19,542
So this is your next tactic?

724
00:40:26,465 --> 00:40:30,344
MINISTER KANG MYEONG-HUI
