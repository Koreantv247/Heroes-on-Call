00:01:09,778 --> 00:01:10,779
THE TRAUMA CODE: HEROES ON CALL

2
00:01:13,031 --> 00:01:15,450
<i>No! I really can't do it.</i>

3
00:01:15,533 --> 00:01:17,452
Really, really, really, really.

4
00:01:25,668 --> 00:01:27,212
Whoa! What are you doing?

5
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:33,051
You're not thinking
of jumping down, are you?

6
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,512
- See you down there.
- Help me!

7
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:37,806
- Can anyone help me?
- Dr. Baek!

8
00:01:44,854 --> 00:01:46,981
Are you sure that man's a doctor?

9
00:01:47,065 --> 00:01:48,733
Someone stop him!

10
00:02:06,584 --> 00:02:09,212
Stop, Dr. Baek, you'll die!
That's a cliff face!

11
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:10,713
Don't go, Dr. Baek! No!

12
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:13,091
No!

13
00:02:21,933 --> 00:02:23,226
Take me with you!

14
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:37,407
Oh, no! Oh, no!

15
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:38,700
This is terrifying.

16
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:42,328
Hold on! I need your help!

17
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:46,416
Who are you?

18
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:49,085
Oh, don't worry.
This is Dr. Baek Kang-hyuk.

19
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:50,086
Stethoscope now!

20
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,838
- Yes, sir. Right here!
- Quickly!

21
00:02:51,921 --> 00:02:52,881
Here.

22
00:03:05,643 --> 00:03:08,605
No breathing sounds
on the upper lobe of the right lung.

23
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:09,647
What's that mean?

24
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:11,441
Uh, uh…

25
00:03:12,108 --> 00:03:13,693
{\an8}Um, it's pneumothorax!

26
00:03:13,776 --> 00:03:16,487
{\an8}I said
there are no breath sounds at all.

27
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:19,032
{\an8}CONDITION WHERE A HOLE
IN THE LUNGS CAUSES AIR TO ACCUMULATE

28
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:21,784
{\an8}- Tension pneumothorax.
- Then what's next?

29
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:22,827
{\an8}Air is trapped!

30
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:24,954
{\an8}We need to extract it with centesis!

31
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:26,122
{\an8}Hold tight!

32
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:58,029
Uh, uh, Dr. Baek!

33
00:03:58,613 --> 00:03:59,864
The patient isn't conscious.

34
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:01,866
But if the trapped air is the cause,
by now--

35
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:04,327
He should be coughing.
Ask him where he is.

36
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:13,753
Pupils… are not responding, Dr. Baek.

37
00:04:13,836 --> 00:04:16,172
{\an8}It's papilledema.
He's hemorrhaged already.

38
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,340
{\an8}What?

39
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:20,093
{\an8}Need to relieve
intracranial pressure now!

40
00:04:20,176 --> 00:04:22,804
{\an8}Can we do that?
Is that even safe to do here?

41
00:04:22,887 --> 00:04:23,846
A decompression?

42
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,431
What's the patient's condition?

43
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:27,225
Let's get him in the air.

44
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:29,769
The helicopter can't stay here.

45
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:32,021
Let's get the patient secured.

46
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:33,231
Uh…

47
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:37,777
Raising the hoist now.

48
00:04:50,748 --> 00:04:52,083
Get ready!

49
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:54,335
We're gonna crack the patient's skull!

50
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:55,461
What?

51
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:56,838
I'm telling you!

52
00:04:57,338 --> 00:04:58,172
Huh? What?

53
00:04:58,256 --> 00:05:00,341
We're gonna crack his skull!

54
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:01,342
Okay?

55
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:04,595
Huh?

56
00:05:14,355 --> 00:05:17,233
Snap out of it!
Gonna let your fear of heights get to you?

57
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:18,901
Focus on the patient. You hear me?

58
00:05:20,236 --> 00:05:21,112
Focus on the patient.

59
00:05:21,195 --> 00:05:22,196
Let's start.

60
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,906
Make it a close shave.

61
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:27,327
Just a moment, Dr. Baek.
Are you really gonna do it here?

62
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:28,745
Yeah, we land in 15.

63
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:31,831
And another 15
between landing and surgery.

64
00:05:31,914 --> 00:05:35,460
If we don't operate immediately,
this guy won't survive the flight.

65
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:37,503
Let's steady his breathing first.

66
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:40,131
We'll go with an incision
instead of intubation.

67
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:05,573
Mr. An. Get the Ambu bag for me.

68
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:07,784
All right. I've got it.

69
00:06:17,126 --> 00:06:18,586
He's practically glowing.

70
00:06:20,963 --> 00:06:22,548
But you said you wanted a close shave.

71
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:24,008
Yeah, it looks good.

72
00:06:25,593 --> 00:06:27,970
Disinfect with Betadine
and pull his scalp open.

73
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:28,971
Yes, sir.

74
00:06:30,264 --> 00:06:31,474
Doctor, um,

75
00:06:32,141 --> 00:06:35,311
is this even possible… in a helicopter?

76
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:39,232
Done it in worse places.

77
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:42,026
Where?

78
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:45,905
Afghanistan.

79
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:02,213
Hey, where's the tool kit?

80
00:07:02,296 --> 00:07:03,798
The box is behind you!

81
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:20,523
Whoa.

82
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:26,404
We've dealt with
the fasciotomy and anesthesia.

83
00:07:26,487 --> 00:07:28,197
What do we do about the hole?

84
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:31,033
- What? You didn't bring a hand drill?
- Pardon?

85
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:33,077
Drill.

86
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:36,289
I guess a hand drill isn't standard
for a trauma kit.

87
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:44,380
What do you want it for?

88
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:45,840
- Pour it on.
- Sir?

89
00:07:45,923 --> 00:07:47,508
- Huh?
- Pour the disinfectant.

90
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:49,051
Pour… Yes, sir.

91
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:51,721
What…

92
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:56,184
- What are you gonna do with that?
- Would you quit running your mouth?

93
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:57,351
This has to be exact.

94
00:07:57,852 --> 00:07:59,562
But, uh…

95
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:02,899
J… j… just wait, Dr. Baek!
This doesn't feel right.

96
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:03,983
Sh!

97
00:08:04,066 --> 00:08:06,569
There has to be another way to do this.

98
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:08,279
All right, here it is.

99
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:17,163
Look at that.

100
00:08:17,246 --> 00:08:19,624
Tea just always tastes better like this.

101
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:29,634
What on earth?

102
00:08:31,385 --> 00:08:32,303
Earthquake.

103
00:08:33,095 --> 00:08:34,096
It's an earthquake.

104
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:40,770
Wow. He actually transported
a patient here via helicopter.

105
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:42,605
I've never seen this happen before.

106
00:08:43,105 --> 00:08:46,526
Oh, I've seen it about ten times.
I've five years' experience, so…

107
00:08:47,401 --> 00:08:48,611
Ten times though?

108
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:50,488
Yes. When Dr. Kwon was here.

109
00:08:50,571 --> 00:08:52,949
However, three of them died
during landing.

110
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:54,408
Really? Why?

111
00:08:55,826 --> 00:08:58,162
It's a pretty hard location
to land, actually.

112
00:08:58,246 --> 00:08:59,830
Each moment is critical.

113
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:02,708
Landing takes forever,
so we really have to hurry.

114
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:05,002
- Ah.
- Gosh.

115
00:09:10,132 --> 00:09:12,218
Here we are. Clear to disembark.

116
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:20,977
One, two, three.

117
00:09:22,186 --> 00:09:24,021
- To the OR immediately!
- Yes, sir.

118
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:26,315
- I need your help with admission!
- Understood.

119
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,275
- And you!
- Yes, sir!

120
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:29,151
Keep a tight grip on that gauze for me.

121
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:30,444
Okay. I'll keep pressure.

122
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:31,362
Let's go!

123
00:09:31,862 --> 00:09:32,697
And push!

124
00:09:47,211 --> 00:09:48,045
Let's go.

125
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:52,675
Dr. Baek. I'm trying
to call the anesthesiologist.

126
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:53,593
What?

127
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:55,845
- What's going on?
- Not responding?

128
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:58,431
His shift's been extended,
so he should be on duty.

129
00:09:58,514 --> 00:10:01,142
This guy… I mean, who does he think he is?

130
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:06,397
{\an8}NURSE KIM SEONG-YUN
EMERGENCY ROOM, HNUH

131
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,690
{\an8}Ten minutes.

132
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:10,818
{\an8}Let's hold out for ten more minutes.
Just ten more minutes.

133
00:10:10,901 --> 00:10:12,403
Okay, ten minutes.

134
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,488
Then I'll clock out.

135
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:16,616
Just a little bit longer.
Okay. Just ten more minutes.

136
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:18,909
<i>So he wants to make sure</i>
<i>he gets off at 12:00?</i>

137
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:22,580
Ah, Jesus! I wanna wring
that little fucker by the neck!

138
00:10:24,248 --> 00:10:27,209
Killing him can wait.
Anesthesia's more important right now.

139
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:28,419
I'll track this guy down.

140
00:10:28,502 --> 00:10:31,047
No. I don't need
assholes like him around here.

141
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:32,340
Find someone else.

142
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:35,217
Nobody else is available right now.
It's just Dr. Hwang Seon-u.

143
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:39,305
Wait. The one we had for
the thoracotomy earlier today.

144
00:10:39,388 --> 00:10:41,557
Park, uh, Gyeong-won?

145
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:43,142
No, no, he's not ready.

146
00:10:43,225 --> 00:10:44,769
- Why not?
- He's a fourth-year.

147
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:47,813
Ah, whatever.
Call him right now for me.

148
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:48,981
Really, now?

149
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:51,484
Fourth-years are usually exempt
from hospital work

150
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:53,235
so they can prepare for their exams.

151
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:55,446
So it'd probably be a major inconvenience.

152
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:58,240
We don't have the luxury of being polite.

153
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:00,993
Otherwise, we'd never save any patients.

154
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:03,537
Just call him right away.
Should I do it?

155
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:04,789
All right.

156
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:12,797
NURSE CHEON JANG-MI

157
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:16,133
This is anesthesiology resident
Park Gyeong-won.

158
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:18,177
<i>This is Dr. Baek Kang-hyuk</i>
<i>from trauma surgery.</i>

159
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:20,012
<i>I need you to come down here right now.</i>

160
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:22,056
All right. What for?

161
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:23,516
Emergency surgery.

162
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:24,892
Huh?

163
00:11:26,143 --> 00:11:27,687
- Are you there?
- Whoa, stop!

164
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:30,314
Why can't I… hear anything?
Hello?

165
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:31,232
<i>Huh?</i>

166
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:33,275
I can't hear anything.

167
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:35,820
Are you crazy?

168
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:42,243
Ah! Dr. Park. Hello.
I'm Nurse Cheon Jang-mi in trauma surgery.

169
00:11:42,743 --> 00:11:45,788
We need a fill-in
for Dr. Hwang Seon-u.

170
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:47,540
And the other doctors on call?

171
00:11:47,623 --> 00:11:49,834
<i>The office wants us</i>
<i>to wait another hour,</i>

172
00:11:49,917 --> 00:11:52,253
<i>but the patient is in</i>
<i>really critical condition.</i>

173
00:11:52,336 --> 00:11:54,046
We need someone now. Hmm.

174
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:01,053
Ah, all right. Fine.

175
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:03,180
<i>Thank you so much.</i>

176
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:08,811
The patient's blood pressure.

177
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:12,815
Push two amps of
IV dexamethasone and up the mannitol.

178
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:14,692
- Yes, Doctor.
- Get me a central line.

179
00:12:14,775 --> 00:12:15,860
Yes, sir.

180
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:20,906
I'll prepare the ultrasound.

181
00:12:28,664 --> 00:12:29,957
{\an8}I can't get a pulse.

182
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:35,296
Are you sticking him right now?
I'll get the ultrasound.

183
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:36,839
Patient'll die before.

184
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:39,592
If you stick him blind,
you could hit an artery! Let me--

185
00:12:39,675 --> 00:12:40,801
Hey, Anus.

186
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:42,636
Watch closely.

187
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:57,610
Seeing the color of the blood,
I've hit the right spot.

188
00:12:58,527 --> 00:12:59,403
Uh…

189
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:02,531
It's important to consider
the actual condition of a trauma patient

190
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:05,618
rather than just referring to
what you learned in a textbook.

191
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:07,620
'Cause if you don't,

192
00:13:07,703 --> 00:13:10,664
you could end up killing a patient
who should have lived.

193
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:12,625
Which you almost did.

194
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:24,220
Let's go with remifentanil
and ketamine as anesthetics.

195
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:26,347
The surgery will relieve
the intracranial pressure.

196
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:27,932
As for the blood pressure,

197
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:30,768
use inotropics if it gets too low.

198
00:13:31,268 --> 00:13:32,394
The heart

199
00:13:33,103 --> 00:13:34,146
will be okay.

200
00:13:38,025 --> 00:13:38,859
<i>No.</i>

201
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:40,611
<i>It's not okay.</i>

202
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:45,908
<i>My heart is pounding.</i>

203
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:04,343
<i>What kind of miracle</i>
<i>is he going to work this time?</i>

204
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,436
Let's begin surgery.

205
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,646
Yes, Doctor.

206
00:14:17,648 --> 00:14:20,568
Ugh! Jesus Christ! That psycho.

207
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:21,986
Huh?

208
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:24,446
First day he calls a helicopter? Huh?

209
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:25,990
Huh? Jae-hun.

210
00:14:26,073 --> 00:14:30,035
Jae-hun. Jae-hun! You see the helicopter?
That Baek Kang-hyuk, he--

211
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:31,871
What's got you so worked up now?

212
00:14:32,913 --> 00:14:34,081
I heard about it too.

213
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:36,500
Apparently, he was transporting a patient.

214
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:38,627
He got in the helicopter
with Yang Jae-won.

215
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:41,589
He's determined to run
this entire hospital into the ground.

216
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:44,550
Wait! Yang Jae-won too?

217
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:47,177
He's the doctor on call
with the Trauma Unit today.

218
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:49,889
Right now, as we speak,
they're in surgery.

219
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,474
Yang Jae-won rode along with

220
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:54,393
Baek Kang-hyuk?

221
00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:57,229
Now they're in surgery?

222
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,982
I have a bad feeling.

223
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:03,527
You don't suppose Baek Kang-hyuk
wants to steal my protégé, do you?

224
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:05,362
- Hold on.
- No, no, that's not it.

225
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:08,699
He wouldn't dare take the head
of general surgery's favorite student.

226
00:15:08,782 --> 00:15:11,368
- The director wants me.
- There is a chance though.

227
00:15:11,869 --> 00:15:14,038
Yang Jae-won <i>is </i>an impressive student.

228
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:20,920
Thank you so much.

229
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:24,965
HANKUK NATIONAL UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL
SCHOLARSHIP PRESENTATION CEREMONY

230
00:15:25,716 --> 00:15:29,428
{\an8}<i>A full ride to Hankuk National</i>
<i>University Medical School.</i>

231
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:31,513
<i>The undisputed valedictorian.</i>

232
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:34,642
I won't let him go.

233
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:36,101
He's my protégé.

234
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:37,061
Ah!

235
00:15:38,687 --> 00:15:39,521
Jae-hun?

236
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:45,819
Wait. What do you mean by that?

237
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:48,072
You're saying they did what now?

238
00:15:48,155 --> 00:15:51,158
The person who introduced
Minister Kang to Dr. Baek

239
00:15:51,241 --> 00:15:53,410
was Director Oh of Chilseong Hospital.

240
00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:59,416
I let myself
get completely blindsided.

241
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,710
Either way, this is all quite worrying.

242
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:05,005
Dr. Baek, they say
he is an incredibly talented surgeon.

243
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:07,257
He even saves patients
at the edge of death.

244
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:09,468
So I'm sure he's gonna pour money
into their treatment.

245
00:16:09,551 --> 00:16:11,720
In that case,
for every life that he saves,

246
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:14,056
this hospital will keep bleeding money!

247
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:16,809
That's exactly what
Director Oh wanted, wasn't it?

248
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,480
When he presented
the minister's recommendation,

249
00:16:22,272 --> 00:16:24,942
we didn't really have
a valid reason to turn him away.

250
00:16:25,567 --> 00:16:26,860
So I was thinking,

251
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:30,114
"Meet him and offer him such a low salary
that he would never wanna work here."

252
00:16:30,197 --> 00:16:31,031
Right?

253
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:43,419
Wow. He's so handsome.

254
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:51,385
Oh. Mr. Baek Kang-hyuk?

255
00:16:51,468 --> 00:16:52,302
Yes.

256
00:16:52,886 --> 00:16:55,389
I'll accept
the attending surgeon position.

257
00:16:55,472 --> 00:16:56,390
Uh…

258
00:16:57,307 --> 00:16:58,183
You mean…

259
00:16:58,934 --> 00:16:59,810
Just like that?

260
00:17:00,602 --> 00:17:02,771
I've always wanted
to work at your hospital.

261
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:06,859
Uh, even so,
uh, at least hear the terms first.

262
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:08,527
What terms? Salary?

263
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:10,779
Salary's quite low, I'm guessing.

264
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:14,658
Shoes like these,
a suit like this, and watches like these,

265
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:18,287
I can already afford all this
with the money I have now.

266
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:21,040
And I'm not a doctor for the money.

267
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:23,167
But duty always calls.

268
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:25,669
- Hmm.
- You seem nice.

269
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:29,089
You don't need the cash,
and you have principles too.

270
00:17:31,091 --> 00:17:32,676
What you don't have is manners.

271
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:35,512
It's no wonder that man's from Muhan.

272
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:37,598
I mean, the lowbrow just act like that.

273
00:17:37,681 --> 00:17:40,267
Always so in-your-face! It's annoying!

274
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:45,022
Uh, Director Choi?

275
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:48,275
What do you think about the idea of

276
00:17:48,358 --> 00:17:50,652
letting him go in our next assessment?

277
00:17:52,821 --> 00:17:54,031
You can't be serious.

278
00:17:55,657 --> 00:17:57,326
Forgive me. It was nothing.

279
00:17:57,993 --> 00:17:59,787
The next assessment's too far away.

280
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:03,916
Honestly, we have to get rid of
this intruder much sooner.

281
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:15,385
{\an8}UNKNOWN MALE
INTRACRANIAL DECOMPRESSION

282
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:16,345
Scalpel.

283
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:31,902
<i>This is crazy.</i>

284
00:18:32,402 --> 00:18:34,113
<i>He shows no hesitation whatsoever.</i>

285
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:40,911
Army.

286
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:45,541
Hand drill.

287
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:55,551
<i>Wow, look.</i>
<i>Look at him handling the drill.</i>

288
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:01,014
Okay, EVD.

289
00:19:04,768 --> 00:19:05,727
Uh… oh…

290
00:19:07,437 --> 00:19:09,648
Oh… Oh!

291
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:14,611
<i>I can't believe how good he is.</i>

292
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:20,159
Uh…

293
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:27,166
All right. The head is done.

294
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:28,959
Next is his lung.

295
00:19:32,754 --> 00:19:34,673
{\an8}UNKNOWN MALE
INTRACRANIAL DECOMPRESSION

296
00:19:34,756 --> 00:19:37,843
{\an8}PARTIAL LUNG RESECTION

297
00:19:55,903 --> 00:19:58,822
<i>First, we cut the artery</i>
<i>in the right lower lobe.</i>

298
00:19:58,906 --> 00:20:00,991
<i>This is to reduce the amount of bleeding.</i>

299
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:08,373
<i>Next, we cut the bronchus to make sure air</i>
<i>doesn't leak into the damaged region.</i>

300
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:15,797
<i>Last is the vein.</i>

301
00:20:19,676 --> 00:20:22,304
<i>Then the right lower lobe</i>
<i>comes away with ease.</i>

302
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:30,729
<i>And the cause of</i>
<i>the patient's pain… is removed.</i>

303
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:34,650
All right. Done.

304
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:37,194
- Send it to the lab.
- Yes, sir.

305
00:20:37,694 --> 00:20:38,862
- Anus.
- Yes, sir?

306
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:40,697
Let's close the chest cavity.

307
00:20:41,198 --> 00:20:44,326
<i>In two hours, he performed</i>
<i>a decompression of intracranial pressure</i>

308
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:46,119
<i>and a partial lung resection.</i>

309
00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:47,037
Hey!

310
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,252
Sending the specimen out.

311
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:09,268
- You're staring.
- What?

312
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:11,812
Are you in awe of my surgical skills?

313
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:16,984
Uh, what? Why would I? I…

314
00:21:19,486 --> 00:21:20,445
You're pretty good.

315
00:21:21,905 --> 00:21:22,906
How would you know?

316
00:21:25,033 --> 00:21:26,159
Got plans for next year?

317
00:21:26,243 --> 00:21:28,537
Can't spend two years
studying colorectal surgery.

318
00:21:29,329 --> 00:21:31,498
Aren't you being dismissive of
other specialties?

319
00:21:31,581 --> 00:21:32,708
What's wrong with colorectal?

320
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:35,294
Well, you're the one being
dismissive and condescending.

321
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:39,131
You have this cushy position,
all while you wait for something to fall

322
00:21:39,214 --> 00:21:40,966
right into your lap. That the plan?

323
00:21:41,758 --> 00:21:43,176
No, it's not.

324
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:44,720
Really?

325
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:49,850
Then allow me to introduce you
to a specialty with a great opening.

326
00:21:49,933 --> 00:21:52,227
Trauma surgery fellow.

327
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:54,104
Fellow, you say?

328
00:21:56,356 --> 00:21:57,899
Is that really your reaction?

329
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:02,404
I'm not saying I don't want it.

330
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:03,447
So it's settled.

331
00:22:04,906 --> 00:22:08,118
Uh, this is all so sudden.
I need more time to think this over.

332
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:12,289
Why? Why can't you do it?

333
00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:15,459
I would like to hear your reasoning.
Go ahead. Come on.

334
00:22:15,542 --> 00:22:18,420
It's just that…
Well, it's not so much that I can't.

335
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:21,590
It's more that it's just a really
consequential life decision.

336
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:24,634
You have three seconds to tell me,
or it's a yes.

337
00:22:27,095 --> 00:22:28,847
It's just that my adviser wants me to be

338
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:31,141
a second-year fellow
in colorectal surgery next year--

339
00:22:31,224 --> 00:22:33,268
- What kind of reason is that?
- Um…

340
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:35,354
Huh? You decide what you want, right?

341
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:37,356
Well…

342
00:22:38,482 --> 00:22:41,610
Right? Think your adviser's always
gonna be there for you?

343
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:43,528
- Uh…
- They promise to make you an attending?

344
00:22:44,571 --> 00:22:47,240
They didn't?
Then why are you so loyal to them?

345
00:22:47,324 --> 00:22:50,035
This isn't about grand gestures.

346
00:22:50,118 --> 00:22:52,371
This is an education. It's really simple.

347
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:54,581
"I will teach you if you want it."

348
00:22:54,664 --> 00:22:56,333
- Yep.
- Ah. My ID.

349
00:22:56,917 --> 00:22:57,918
Oh, right, Dr. Baek.

350
00:22:58,543 --> 00:22:59,586
- Thank you.
- Yep.

351
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:04,466
I'm offering you a really great deal.
I'm the best mentor you could ask for.

352
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:05,384
You know that.

353
00:23:08,595 --> 00:23:10,430
I understand what you're saying.

354
00:23:12,349 --> 00:23:14,434
Ah! There's just no way.
My adviser won't--

355
00:23:14,518 --> 00:23:16,686
Your damn adviser again?

356
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:21,191
You're saying that this adviser guy
calls the shots, right?

357
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:24,903
Okay.

358
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:27,114
Where are you going?

359
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:35,372
Who could it be? Huh?

360
00:23:35,455 --> 00:23:37,874
Who decided
to put all these boxes right here?

361
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:41,503
Who put Dr. Baek's stuff here?
Who the hell did this? Confess!

362
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:45,882
Seriously? The man's been working here
one day, and he's already a nuisance!

363
00:23:46,383 --> 00:23:49,136
This is ridiculous.
I'm the head of general surgery,

364
00:23:49,219 --> 00:23:51,263
and he hasn't even stopped by
to introduce himself,

365
00:23:51,346 --> 00:23:52,597
even though I'm right next door.

366
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:54,599
- Talking about me?
- Ah!

367
00:23:56,726 --> 00:23:57,686
What are you doing?

368
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:02,607
I came to introduce myself
since we're neighbors.

369
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:09,072
Ah, well… So you let yourself in
without asking permission?

370
00:24:09,156 --> 00:24:11,408
Come on, take a seat.
It's an urgent matter.

371
00:24:11,491 --> 00:24:13,869
It's my office!
You don't get to tell me to--

372
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:15,370
You prefer to stand?

373
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:16,538
Whatever suits you.

374
00:24:16,621 --> 00:24:18,957
All right, let's talk.

375
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:20,417
Dammit.

376
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:25,046
All right.

377
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:26,047
What's so urgent?

378
00:24:27,048 --> 00:24:31,553
You have a fellow working for you called
Yang Jae-won, isn't that right?

379
00:24:32,053 --> 00:24:33,430
Yes, I do.

380
00:24:34,014 --> 00:24:36,224
Real whiz kid. My protégé.

381
00:24:37,017 --> 00:24:40,020
All right, well, uh,
I'd like to teach him for a change.

382
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:45,150
Didn't they teach you etiquette
at your university?

383
00:24:45,233 --> 00:24:47,652
Now, look here, Dr. Baek.

384
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:50,071
He is my fellow! Got it? My fellow!

385
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:53,950
Yours? Oh, come on now.
Don't be like that.

386
00:24:54,534 --> 00:24:58,455
I would argue that
this is a decision only he can make.

387
00:25:01,541 --> 00:25:02,667
Oh really?

388
00:25:04,252 --> 00:25:07,923
Well, did he say that he would choose
trauma surgery if we let him decide?

389
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:09,925
He and I go way back, you understand?

390
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:12,385
No way that he would do
something like that.

391
00:25:12,469 --> 00:25:15,013
You mean… you're not worried?

392
00:25:16,306 --> 00:25:18,934
Not even a little?
Like, what if he rejects you?

393
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:20,644
Are you serious? Not at all.

394
00:25:21,144 --> 00:25:25,440
So… in that case,
let's let Yang Jae-won decide.

395
00:25:26,316 --> 00:25:27,400
Deal?

396
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:29,486
Deal.

397
00:25:29,569 --> 00:25:30,570
Okay.

398
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:35,033
The three of us should meet
at four o'clock to discuss it together.

399
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:39,829
Somehow, I feel cheated.

400
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:43,083
Take the offer.

401
00:25:44,167 --> 00:25:45,210
Don't take it.

402
00:25:45,293 --> 00:25:46,336
Take the offer.

403
00:25:47,337 --> 00:25:48,255
Don't take it.

404
00:25:48,838 --> 00:25:49,839
Take the offer?

405
00:25:50,423 --> 00:25:51,258
Don't take it.

406
00:25:53,426 --> 00:25:55,262
There is my answer. No deal.

407
00:25:55,345 --> 00:25:56,471
There you are!

408
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:58,848
The great Dr. Yang Jae-dong.

409
00:25:58,932 --> 00:26:00,517
So what brings you to the roof?

410
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,560
Dr. Yang Jae-dong,

411
00:26:01,643 --> 00:26:04,813
the man who got an offer
to join the trauma surgery department.

412
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:10,193
You know, something's off about you.

413
00:26:10,694 --> 00:26:11,820
It's your expression.

414
00:26:12,362 --> 00:26:13,780
Like you're deep in thought.

415
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:18,451
It's just that if… if I had received
that offer yesterday,

416
00:26:18,535 --> 00:26:19,869
I would've rejected it.

417
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:21,788
- Yeah?
- And yet…

418
00:26:23,331 --> 00:26:25,584
I can't avoid having
these strange thoughts.

419
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:30,213
"If I join trauma surgery,
could I become like Dr. Baek?" You know?

420
00:26:31,339 --> 00:26:33,758
What? No! You're nothing alike.

421
00:26:33,842 --> 00:26:34,926
Wh… why?

422
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:36,595
I heard about the helicopter.

423
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:39,598
And that… you rappelled down.

424
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:42,892
Well, can you keep doing things like that?

425
00:26:49,649 --> 00:26:52,027
- Ah!
- Eh?

426
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:53,820
Yeah, yeah, I couldn't do that.

427
00:26:54,362 --> 00:26:55,447
Jae-won.

428
00:26:56,031 --> 00:26:58,867
Do you possess a powerful sense of duty?

429
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:00,452
- You mean like--
- Yeah.

430
00:27:01,036 --> 00:27:02,162
Or like

431
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:04,539
are you a risk-taker?

432
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:06,708
No, I'm the most ordinary person I know.

433
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:07,792
That's right!

434
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:13,340
Only risk-takers with a sense of duty
can survive in the trauma department.

435
00:27:13,423 --> 00:27:14,799
Just like…

436
00:27:15,508 --> 00:27:16,718
like Dr. Baek.

437
00:27:17,677 --> 00:27:18,762
Hmm?

438
00:27:21,431 --> 00:27:22,682
See you down there.

439
00:27:26,603 --> 00:27:28,980
A risk-taker with a sense of duty.

440
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:33,526
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You're… you're right. I agree.

441
00:27:34,027 --> 00:27:35,612
You made it all make sense.

442
00:27:35,695 --> 00:27:37,906
- I appreciate that. See you later. Yeah.
- 'Kay.

443
00:27:57,258 --> 00:27:59,052
<i>Dr. Baek.</i>
<i>Thank you for the offer.</i>

444
00:27:59,135 --> 00:28:01,680
<i>But I've decided to dedicate my life</i>
<i>to colorectal surgery.</i>

445
00:28:01,763 --> 00:28:02,764
Oh, come on.

446
00:28:04,099 --> 00:28:05,975
<i>Four o'clock. My office.</i>

447
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:12,107
Hey, Gangster.

448
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:16,403
- Oh, hey, boss.
- Huh?

449
00:28:17,278 --> 00:28:21,282
Ah. Well, you call me "Gangster,"
so it's only right you're my boss.

450
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:24,703
You're wearing a white coat today.
You look like a real doctor now.

451
00:28:25,412 --> 00:28:26,413
Enough of that.

452
00:28:27,288 --> 00:28:29,499
I need to know how to win someone over.

453
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:31,084
Win someone over?

454
00:28:31,668 --> 00:28:34,587
I heard you with the anesthesiologist.
You were convincing.

455
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:38,508
I didn't have to win him over.
I was asking him for a favor.

456
00:28:38,591 --> 00:28:40,051
Yeah, well, it was effective.

457
00:28:40,593 --> 00:28:41,970
Give me some tips, will ya?

458
00:28:42,595 --> 00:28:43,555
I don't want to.

459
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:45,890
Yang Jae-won.

460
00:28:46,975 --> 00:28:48,935
What if he worked as a fellow in here?

461
00:28:50,687 --> 00:28:51,604
Who?

462
00:28:52,355 --> 00:28:53,815
Yang Jae-won.

463
00:28:53,898 --> 00:28:55,275
Jae-won, huh?

464
00:28:56,401 --> 00:29:00,363
Well, I will say that Jae-won is liked
by all the Trauma Unit nurses here.

465
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:03,074
Oh, I'm sure he is.
A soft-hearted guy like that.

466
00:29:03,908 --> 00:29:05,034
Ah, it's just that

467
00:29:06,703 --> 00:29:09,622
he's saying he doesn't want it.

468
00:29:09,706 --> 00:29:11,249
How sad for you.

469
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:13,042
Listen to me.

470
00:29:13,126 --> 00:29:15,378
As someone who's worked here
for five years,

471
00:29:15,462 --> 00:29:18,715
you don't want the Trauma Unit
to be completely dissolved, right?

472
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:21,176
'Cause we're in the same boat now.

473
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:24,471
And I want another person to row with us.

474
00:29:24,554 --> 00:29:27,056
- Yeah?
- One more, hmm.

475
00:29:28,933 --> 00:29:30,643
We should talk in private.

476
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:34,105
No, no, no!

477
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:36,608
No! That's not what I'm saying here.

478
00:29:38,318 --> 00:29:40,612
Jae-won is a compassionate guy.

479
00:29:40,695 --> 00:29:42,989
Try being a little more compassionate.

480
00:29:43,072 --> 00:29:46,201
Gonna be difficult
since I'm known for being an asshole,

481
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:48,244
and you're saying be compassionate.

482
00:29:48,328 --> 00:29:50,872
Be compassionate, huh? Like how?

483
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:53,666
You know.
Why did you want to become a doctor?

484
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:55,585
Me? 'Cause of my father.

485
00:29:57,504 --> 00:30:00,423
Oh, that's perfect! Ooh!

486
00:30:00,507 --> 00:30:03,885
Have a sit-down where you exchange stories
like that back and forth.

487
00:30:03,968 --> 00:30:07,514
Ah! Using my own story like that, huh?

488
00:30:07,597 --> 00:30:09,849
Yeah, you're not lying or anything.

489
00:30:09,933 --> 00:30:12,310
Just have a conversation
with him, Dr. Baek.

490
00:30:12,393 --> 00:30:15,855
Don't all personal connections
begin with conversation?

491
00:30:20,026 --> 00:30:21,110
Eh…

492
00:30:21,194 --> 00:30:23,655
Seriously. You don't have time for this.

493
00:30:23,738 --> 00:30:25,990
It looks like Dr. Han already got to work.

494
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:27,492
What?

495
00:30:27,575 --> 00:30:29,619
I called about removing a patient
from the ICU,

496
00:30:29,702 --> 00:30:32,539
and they told me
Jae-won got a call from Dr. Han.

497
00:30:32,622 --> 00:30:35,208
What? Oh shit.

498
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:42,966
This teacup.

499
00:30:44,884 --> 00:30:46,261
It's a Goryeo celadon.

500
00:30:48,221 --> 00:30:51,766
It's a beautiful thing.
It adds something special to the tea.

501
00:30:54,435 --> 00:30:56,479
Oh, yes. Drink, drink.

502
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:00,275
- Mmm.
- That's hot.

503
00:31:02,068 --> 00:31:05,864
You and I graduated
from Hankuk National University.

504
00:31:06,447 --> 00:31:09,951
Which lends a certain credibility
to what we say. Hmm?

505
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:13,079
Going forward, you should follow my lead.

506
00:31:13,162 --> 00:31:14,873
I promise it'll be smooth sailing.

507
00:31:14,956 --> 00:31:18,293
You struggling under the supervision
of that Muhan University grad

508
00:31:18,376 --> 00:31:19,377
would be a tragedy.

509
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:21,421
And I don't want that for you.

510
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:25,258
- Mmm.
- Uh, Dr. Han.

511
00:31:25,341 --> 00:31:26,426
Oh, yes?

512
00:31:26,509 --> 00:31:29,888
If this is about
Dr. Baek Kang-hyuk's offer, I apologize.

513
00:31:31,514 --> 00:31:35,059
You know,
I wanted to see you because I recalled

514
00:31:35,643 --> 00:31:39,022
that when my mentor left,
he gave me this teacup as a gift.

515
00:31:40,189 --> 00:31:43,985
He said that one day,
I would find a protégé worthy of it.

516
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:47,363
And I think I've finally realized
who that is.

517
00:31:49,949 --> 00:31:50,783
You have?

518
00:31:52,869 --> 00:31:53,745
You.

519
00:32:07,717 --> 00:32:09,636
Oh, it's no big deal.

520
00:32:09,719 --> 00:32:10,887
- What the--
- Dr. Baek.

521
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:12,805
What are… what are you doing?

522
00:32:12,889 --> 00:32:15,099
What are you doing? Wait!
Whoa! What the hell?

523
00:32:15,183 --> 00:32:17,310
- The hell? Have you completely lost it?
- Wait, wait!

524
00:32:17,393 --> 00:32:18,937
What are you doing barging in like this?

525
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:22,023
I believe the three of us should talk now.

526
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:24,108
We said four o'clock earlier.

527
00:32:24,192 --> 00:32:26,986
And that we would meet
to talk about it together.

528
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:31,115
But… it's only 3:20 right now.

529
00:32:31,658 --> 00:32:34,661
Oh yeah? We don't have to wait until then.
Let's talk about it right now.

530
00:32:35,578 --> 00:32:36,746
Yes, let's do it.

531
00:32:37,538 --> 00:32:38,998
Hey now!

532
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:41,084
This is great. Take a seat.

533
00:32:41,167 --> 00:32:42,794
Always so disrespectful.

534
00:32:44,003 --> 00:32:45,046
So tell me.

535
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:46,464
Yes?

536
00:32:46,547 --> 00:32:49,926
Are you choosing colorectal surgery
or trauma surgery?

537
00:32:52,178 --> 00:32:53,388
The thing is…

538
00:32:55,014 --> 00:32:56,975
Of course
it's colorectal surgery.

539
00:32:57,058 --> 00:32:59,227
I've already taught him all the basics.

540
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:02,647
He'll start writing his own papers
next year and soon become an attending.

541
00:33:03,898 --> 00:33:04,732
Attending?

542
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:06,109
You know that's never happening.

543
00:33:06,192 --> 00:33:08,069
He wants you to do grunt work
for two years

544
00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:09,946
in exchange for making you a specialist.

545
00:33:10,029 --> 00:33:12,740
Excuse me. Why do you have to put
such a terrible spin on things?

546
00:33:12,824 --> 00:33:16,202
Hold on. You're saying you have
an attending position ready to go?

547
00:33:16,285 --> 00:33:18,788
An attending isn't something
you can just offer.

548
00:33:18,871 --> 00:33:20,373
When one becomes available,

549
00:33:20,456 --> 00:33:23,292
only those who are ready
will be able to take it. Understand?

550
00:33:23,376 --> 00:33:26,421
Right. And that's exactly what
I want to explain to him right now.

551
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:30,925
I can prepare him for that as well. Huh?
Under my supervision, in just…

552
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:34,929
In five years, I promise you

553
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:36,973
he'll be able to do
a quarter of what I can.

554
00:33:37,056 --> 00:33:38,016
Five years…

555
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:41,894
Gee. I wonder why such a talented man
ended up studying at Muhan University.

556
00:33:41,978 --> 00:33:45,898
Ha! You think doctors
save people's lives with their degrees?

557
00:33:45,982 --> 00:33:48,317
Baek Kang-hyuk, level with me.

558
00:33:48,401 --> 00:33:51,320
Why are you working here, hmm?
You're here to polish your résumé

559
00:33:51,404 --> 00:33:54,115
after graduating from such
an embarrassment of a university!

560
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:56,117
- Take it easy, Dr. Baek.
- Shut it!

561
00:33:56,784 --> 00:33:58,327
- Are you done talking now?
- What the--

562
00:33:58,411 --> 00:33:59,412
Say it again!

563
00:33:59,495 --> 00:34:01,414
Yeah? Well, I wasn't finished talking!

564
00:34:01,914 --> 00:34:04,292
You were the one who started
talking smack, huh?

565
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:06,753
All while you keep
going on about your skills.

566
00:34:06,836 --> 00:34:07,670
Guess what?

567
00:34:07,754 --> 00:34:10,214
Those credentials everyone respects,
I have those.

568
00:34:10,298 --> 00:34:12,675
That's right.
I went to Hankuk National University

569
00:34:12,759 --> 00:34:14,927
and obtained a subspecialty
in colorectal surgery.

570
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:17,430
- Yeah? What else?
- A subspecialty in colonoscopy.

571
00:34:17,513 --> 00:34:20,308
A Ministry of Health and Welfare
certified colorectal specialist.

572
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:21,976
A specialist in colorectal medicine.

573
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:23,686
Lifetime member, Korean Surgical Society.

574
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:25,605
Clinical instructor,
Hankuk National University.

575
00:34:25,688 --> 00:34:27,315
Colombian Colorectal Society.

576
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:29,108
Korean Society for Vascular Surgery.

577
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:38,159
MUHAN UNIVERSITY GRADUATE
FIRST ATTENDING SURGEON ROLE

578
00:34:38,242 --> 00:34:41,120
So, will he choose
the credentials of Han Yu-rim

579
00:34:41,204 --> 00:34:42,872
or the skills of Baek Kang-hyuk?

580
00:34:43,456 --> 00:34:47,502
That's gotta be a headache
for Dr. Yang. He has to choose one.

581
00:34:48,002 --> 00:34:50,963
Does that mean, if we're lucky,
Dr. Yang will work with us?

582
00:34:51,047 --> 00:34:52,507
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

583
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:54,592
Obviously, it's no contest.

584
00:34:54,675 --> 00:34:57,678
The head of general surgery
has more clout than some newbie.

585
00:34:58,596 --> 00:34:59,430
Right.

586
00:35:00,139 --> 00:35:04,852
Dr. Baek will just end up like Dr. Kwon,
fighting tooth and nail all on his own.

587
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:06,604
That would be my guess.

588
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:08,940
Bet on it?

589
00:35:10,608 --> 00:35:11,651
Hmm?

590
00:35:11,734 --> 00:35:12,568
Eh.

591
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:16,322
How much?

592
00:35:18,241 --> 00:35:21,119
You know, the number of plaques
I've received from these societies

593
00:35:21,202 --> 00:35:24,455
for my exemplary work
is as many as my age.

594
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:27,083
Jae-won, commit yourself to your work,

595
00:35:27,166 --> 00:35:30,419
and one day, you can reach
the same heights that I have. Understand?

596
00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:36,008
You don't have
a single picture taken with a patient.

597
00:35:36,509 --> 00:35:37,510
What's that?

598
00:35:39,178 --> 00:35:40,555
Is this a difficult choice?

599
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,017
Yes.

600
00:35:45,601 --> 00:35:46,435
Why?

601
00:35:47,186 --> 00:35:48,020
To be honest,

602
00:35:49,397 --> 00:35:51,315
I'm not confident with trauma surgery.

603
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:57,071
Not confident.

604
00:35:59,323 --> 00:36:00,324
Yang Jae-won.

605
00:36:01,367 --> 00:36:03,411
It's time for you to decide. Huh?

606
00:36:05,246 --> 00:36:06,998
Colorectal or trauma surgery?

607
00:36:08,791 --> 00:36:09,625
Uh…

608
00:36:11,127 --> 00:36:12,628
Is it me or Baek Kang-hyuk?

609
00:36:12,712 --> 00:36:14,463
I think, Dr. Han, um…

610
00:36:14,547 --> 00:36:16,424
- It's me, isn't it? Isn't it?
- Uh…

611
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:17,800
- Well…
- Forget it.

612
00:36:20,469 --> 00:36:21,429
I said forget it.

613
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:25,892
Kids like you who weigh the odds,
you can't save lives.

614
00:36:26,767 --> 00:36:29,353
You'll lose patients hesitating like that.

615
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:35,902
Don't worry about him.

616
00:36:40,948 --> 00:36:42,074
- Yang Jae-won.
- Uh, Dr. Baek.

617
00:36:42,158 --> 00:36:43,576
- Hold on! Yang Jae-won.
- Just wait!

618
00:36:44,076 --> 00:36:45,703
Yang Jae-won.

619
00:36:48,915 --> 00:36:49,874
Just a minute.

620
00:36:50,958 --> 00:36:52,877
Dr. Baek.

621
00:36:53,419 --> 00:36:54,378
The thing is…

622
00:36:55,004 --> 00:36:56,297
What I meant was…

623
00:36:56,380 --> 00:37:00,551
What I was thinking was…
what I could even do as a trauma surgeon?

624
00:37:00,635 --> 00:37:01,761
Isn't it obvious?

625
00:37:02,428 --> 00:37:05,223
The things that happened today
will continue to happen.

626
00:37:05,973 --> 00:37:07,058
And over time,

627
00:37:08,392 --> 00:37:11,479
eventually, you'll be able to
save lives all on your own.

628
00:37:19,779 --> 00:37:21,280
All of those people.

629
00:37:21,781 --> 00:37:23,532
Are they all patients you've saved?

630
00:37:27,495 --> 00:37:28,579
Rania.

631
00:37:29,538 --> 00:37:31,999
She suffered so much brain damage
after a bombing

632
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:34,293
<i>that the surgery took eight whole hours.</i>

633
00:37:34,377 --> 00:37:37,088
<i>Bombs were falling, and we were</i>
<i>running low on blood to transfuse.</i>

634
00:37:37,171 --> 00:37:38,256
Well done.

635
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:40,841
It was a tough battle
for that young child.

636
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:42,176
Did she survive?

637
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:44,095
Yeah. She wants to be a doctor.

638
00:37:49,308 --> 00:37:52,395
That old guy over there is… Masoud.

639
00:37:52,478 --> 00:37:56,649
He flat-out refused to be treated
by any other doctor. I was the only one.

640
00:37:56,732 --> 00:37:59,860
I don't trust him.
Bring me a Muslim doctor.

641
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:02,238
Jesus, old man.
You're a stubborn one.

642
00:38:02,321 --> 00:38:04,407
Your blood pressure's dropping. Quiet!

643
00:38:06,367 --> 00:38:07,660
What is that?

644
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:12,540
Ah. Finally, some quiet.

645
00:38:14,166 --> 00:38:17,086
<i>He kept talking about</i>
<i>wanting me to be his son-in-law.</i>

646
00:38:19,005 --> 00:38:21,007
He considered you part of his family.

647
00:38:26,387 --> 00:38:28,389
<i>Jae-won is a compassionate guy.</i>

648
00:38:28,472 --> 00:38:30,850
Try being a little more compassionate.

649
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:35,104
So…

650
00:38:39,859 --> 00:38:41,694
…why did you wanna become a doctor?

651
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:51,537
Do you think that…

652
00:38:53,539 --> 00:38:56,292
like me,
it's because you wanted to save lives?

653
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:02,131
Yang Jae-won! Yang Jae-won!

654
00:39:02,965 --> 00:39:03,841
Dr. Yang.

655
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:05,176
Son of a bitch.

656
00:39:05,259 --> 00:39:07,720
I said I'd give you this. Look!
Why can't you see how I feel?

657
00:39:07,803 --> 00:39:09,013
I want you to have this!

658
00:39:11,557 --> 00:39:12,475
Dr. Han.

659
00:39:13,684 --> 00:39:14,977
I don't think that I

660
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:17,188
want that teacup anymore.

661
00:39:17,271 --> 00:39:19,440
Huh?

662
00:39:19,523 --> 00:39:21,734
This is from the Goryeo dynasty.
It's Goryeo celadon.

663
00:39:21,817 --> 00:39:23,819
Haven't you heard of Goryeo celadons?

664
00:39:23,903 --> 00:39:24,779
I will…

665
00:39:27,406 --> 00:39:29,158
join the trauma surgery department.

666
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:31,786
You don't understand.

667
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:34,663
Fellows, you know?
They don't choose the field they're in.

668
00:39:34,747 --> 00:39:35,998
They do what they're told to do.

669
00:39:36,082 --> 00:39:38,959
Hey, hey!
Didn't you say his decision was final?

670
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:40,795
- No, no. That was--
- Right, let's get to work.

671
00:39:40,878 --> 00:39:41,796
- No. Wait.
- Uh…

672
00:39:41,879 --> 00:39:43,464
- Wait a minute!
- I'm sorry, but--

673
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:45,091
- Yang Jae-won!
- I'm sorry, sir!

674
00:39:45,174 --> 00:39:46,842
- Please stay healthy, sir!
- Yang Jae-won!

675
00:39:46,926 --> 00:39:49,929
You better let go of me! Let go!
Don't touch me. Get off!

676
00:39:50,012 --> 00:39:52,098
- You son of a bitch.
- You can't be serious.

677
00:39:52,181 --> 00:39:54,767
That right there is just a knock-off.

678
00:39:55,476 --> 00:39:57,603
You have no clue
what you're talking about.

679
00:39:57,686 --> 00:39:59,313
No, I'm pretty good at that sort of thing.

680
00:40:00,314 --> 00:40:03,401
Goryeo celadons…
aren't typically decorated this way.

681
00:40:04,693 --> 00:40:07,113
You should get it… Go get it appraised.

682
00:40:07,196 --> 00:40:08,906
What the hell do you know?

683
00:40:14,328 --> 00:40:15,287
Knock-off.

684
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:19,291
Knock-off?

685
00:40:22,002 --> 00:40:23,254
Yang Jae-won.

686
00:40:23,337 --> 00:40:25,423
You're my enemy from now on.

687
00:40:25,506 --> 00:40:28,300
As a fellow alumnus,
I took good care of you.

688
00:40:28,801 --> 00:40:30,302
But now he's a traitor!

689
00:40:31,554 --> 00:40:34,014
He dares reject me? Traitor!

690
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:36,142
Yang Jae-won.

691
00:40:38,727 --> 00:40:39,687
Traitor.

692
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:53,159
WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEND THE EMAIL?
YES

693
00:40:54,827 --> 00:40:57,037
Huh? What is this?

694
00:40:57,121 --> 00:40:58,414
What on earth?

695
00:40:58,497 --> 00:40:59,331
Seriously?

696
00:41:26,984 --> 00:41:28,360
Ah!

697
00:41:28,444 --> 00:41:30,988
All right, all right, all right.
Tell me. Spit it out.

698
00:41:31,071 --> 00:41:33,741
Let's start off with some deep breaths.
You remember Lamaze breathing?

699
00:41:36,118 --> 00:41:38,412
Ugh. Would you just tell me?
I don't have time for all this.

700
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:41,040
Hey! The fellows are freaking out.

701
00:41:41,123 --> 00:41:44,251
Dr. Han Yu-rim sent an email to everybody.

702
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:46,504
So what was it about? What? What?

703
00:41:46,587 --> 00:41:49,673
"From now on--"
Ugh. Here. It's right here.

704
00:41:49,757 --> 00:41:52,384
- Let's see. C'mon. What?
- I can't bring myself to read it out loud.

705
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:56,514
"Starting today,
all Trauma Unit on-call duties

706
00:41:56,597 --> 00:41:58,891
are reassigned to Dr. Yang Jae-won."

707
00:42:07,483 --> 00:42:11,320
ALL TRAUMA TEAM ON-CALL DUTIES
ARE ASSIGNED TO YANG JAE-WON

708
00:42:12,613 --> 00:42:15,824
Hey. Just apologize. Get on your knees
and grovel for dear life.

709
00:42:15,908 --> 00:42:18,786
I can't, I can't, I can't.
I won't, I won't.

710
00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:21,497
You take all these on-call shifts,
you'll be in deep shit.

711
00:42:26,669 --> 00:42:30,172
TRAUMA TEAM: YANG JAE-WON, YANG JAE-WON,
YANG JAE-WON, YANG JAE-WON, YANG JAE-WON

712
00:42:30,256 --> 00:42:32,174
Pushing him
off the cliff, huh?

713
00:42:51,318 --> 00:42:52,278
Yes, Doctor?

714
00:42:52,361 --> 00:42:54,947
<i>What's with your voice?</i>
<i>Did someone die? Are you crying?</i>

715
00:42:55,030 --> 00:42:56,156
No, it's just

716
00:42:57,199 --> 00:42:58,659
I'm in deep shit now.

717
00:42:59,702 --> 00:43:03,080
It appears Dr. Han Yu-rim
has assigned all on-call duties

718
00:43:03,163 --> 00:43:04,748
to me for the Trauma Unit.

719
00:43:05,749 --> 00:43:06,875
So what?

720
00:43:06,959 --> 00:43:09,086
Trauma department
is always on call anyway.

721
00:43:09,169 --> 00:43:10,004
Ah.

722
00:43:10,087 --> 00:43:12,673
In Korea, one specialist handles
all trauma patients

723
00:43:12,756 --> 00:43:15,926
24 hours a day, 365 days a year.

724
00:43:17,177 --> 00:43:18,012
Hey.

725
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:22,600
Don't tell me you didn't consider that
when you agreed to join trauma surgery.

726
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:24,810
Huh?

727
00:43:28,856 --> 00:43:31,942
You just… haven't found your place yet.

728
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:34,570
Hey, I'm right here.

729
00:43:39,408 --> 00:43:41,619
Ah, Jesus. Dr. Baek.

730
00:43:46,415 --> 00:43:47,374
Don't worry.

731
00:43:49,043 --> 00:43:51,587
You won't have to work those shifts
on your own for now.

732
00:43:54,089 --> 00:43:56,050
Can't let you go around killing people.

733
00:43:58,385 --> 00:44:00,679
In a way, this is actually good for you.

734
00:44:00,763 --> 00:44:02,723
You need to be on call anyway.

735
00:44:02,806 --> 00:44:04,975
At least the whole hospital
knows about it now

736
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:07,603
and that we're working our asses off.

737
00:44:08,354 --> 00:44:12,232
I think it's always good when everybody
else knows what you're going through.

738
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:13,817
Hmm?

739
00:44:15,944 --> 00:44:17,905
Let's go. We should check on the ICU.

740
00:44:17,988 --> 00:44:19,448
So, uh,

741
00:44:20,366 --> 00:44:22,826
why pick me of all people, anyway?

742
00:44:27,873 --> 00:44:28,707
Easy.

743
00:44:29,416 --> 00:44:30,626
I saw how you run.

744
00:44:37,007 --> 00:44:40,719
<i>Every single time I saw you…</i>
<i>you were running.</i>

745
00:44:41,929 --> 00:44:43,305
<i>Off to save a patient.</i>

746
00:44:56,068 --> 00:44:57,152
Then I'll work hard…

747
00:44:59,154 --> 00:45:02,032
so you don't… regret your choice.

748
00:45:03,951 --> 00:45:07,705
Well, I'm gonna make sure
that you… regret your choice.

749
00:45:17,297 --> 00:45:19,633
By the way, Dr. Baek,
weren't you on the Syria team

750
00:45:19,717 --> 00:45:22,344
as part of
the Doctors for International Peace?

751
00:45:22,428 --> 00:45:24,096
Yes. Why?

752
00:45:24,847 --> 00:45:27,266
But didn't you say
you were in Afghanistan?

753
00:45:29,143 --> 00:45:30,269
Never mind that.

754
00:45:30,352 --> 00:45:32,688
Why don't you just go reply
to Dr. Han's email?

755
00:45:35,357 --> 00:45:38,068
<i>Hello, Dr. Han.</i>
<i>This is Yang Jae-won.</i>

756
00:45:38,569 --> 00:45:41,113
<i>Dr. Baek has asked me</i>
<i>to pass on a message.</i>

757
00:45:41,864 --> 00:45:44,491
<i>He says that the teacup is Goryeo celadon.</i>

758
00:45:47,619 --> 00:45:53,292
Baek Kang-hyuk!

759
00:45:57,546 --> 00:46:00,299
"Trauma Center."
It has a nice ring to it.

760
00:46:00,382 --> 00:46:02,301
Now, Anus, you just follow my lead.

761
00:46:02,384 --> 00:46:04,511
- Yes, Dr. Baek.
- Congratulations!

762
00:46:17,733 --> 00:46:20,110
Aah. I love the smell of cash.

763
00:46:20,736 --> 00:46:23,739
I wonder
if Jae-won is gonna last though.

764
00:46:24,239 --> 00:46:25,199
We'll see.

765
00:46:28,118 --> 00:46:29,203
Double or nothing?

766
00:46:30,537 --> 00:46:31,497
You're on!

767
00:46:33,665 --> 00:46:36,835
<i>Today, I finally accepted</i>
<i>what Dr. Baek was trying to tell me.</i>

768
00:46:39,004 --> 00:46:42,591
<i>That if I continue to follow him,</i>
<i>to learn from him just as I am now,</i>

769
00:46:44,092 --> 00:46:46,929
<i>then one day,</i>
<i>I will be that kind of doctor,</i>

770
00:46:47,012 --> 00:46:48,722
<i>the kind that saves lives.</i>

771
00:46:50,557 --> 00:46:54,394
<i>And this is only the beginning,</i>
<i>not just for the Trauma Center,</i>

772
00:46:54,478 --> 00:46:56,355
<i>but for my life as a doctor too.</i>
